I have been very interested in learning languages since I was young. During the vacation after the college entrance examination, I took a Spanish course. However, I did not master the language as expected.

Afterwards, I accidentally found a Spanish teacher on Youtube who used English to teach Spanish. Compared to learning Spanish in Chinese, it is better to learn Spanish in English. Although English is not my native language, I still think it feel better. I didn't understand why this happened, until one day I discovered that something more important than vocabularies or grammar, that language thinking is more important for people who learn languages. The reason why learning Spanish through English is more effective is that they have very similar thinking.
Therefore, I would like to recommend two resources to learn Spanish more efficiently.

 [this vedio:Spanish class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FB1nO6ckZI&list=PLKQEL9j11yiUQ5SWdkc6ZT6A1NRoaskst).There are a total of 200 videos here.Each episode is about fifteen minutes, which can completely replace the time spent browsing Twitter or Instagram. Isn't it worthwhile to spend this time learning a new language? Meanwhile the practice of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) can be combined with the vedio which is enough to master daily communication. 
 
 Of course, Duolingo’s exercises are more suitable for beginners. When it comes to more difficult vocabulary and grammar, we should consider preparing a Spanish dictionary to look up verb conjugations.
 
 Here I recommend two website:[spanishdict](https://www.spanishdict.com/) and [西語助手](https://www.esdict.cn/). They also provide application on cell phone.Some extra features need to be charged, but it is very useful to find verb conjugations.
