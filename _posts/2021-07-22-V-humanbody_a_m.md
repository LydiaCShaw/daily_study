In optimal conditions, an organism and its organs develop without any abnormalities. However, the normal path of embryonic development could be disrupted and the evolving organism could become abnormal, with certain organs or even the whole body becoming anomalous. The causes of such deviations may be external or internal.

Abnormalities of organs can be manifested as follows:
1. The organ may be positioned wrongly.
2. The organ may be absent (aplasia).
3. The organ may merge with adjacent organs.
4. There may be an additional organ.
5. The shape of the organ may be altered.

About the anomalies of the spine, *V.A. Dyachenko's* classification(1954) is the most complete one.

#### 1. Clefts and defects of vertebral bodies
Congenital clefts or the condition in which the vertebrae remain unfused and open are known as 'spina bifida'. In the majority of cases, these defects are caused by disorders in the development of the vertebral bodies during the foetal stages. The location of the clefts varies.

According to the literature, the most common type (30%-35%) of spina bifida is the incomplete closure of the arch of the 1st sacral vertebra (spina bifida posterior). The second most common location is the 5th lumbar vertebra. Clefts are less common in the cervicothoracic region.

Spina bifida anterior is rare. The anomaly is confined mainly to the level of the lower cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae, but can affect any vertebra in other regions of the spine. Usually, there is splitting of a few adjacent vertebral bodies. In the vast majority of cases, spina bifida anterior is not a single developmental anomaly, but often occurs in conjunction with other severe spinal deformities, such as synostoses and malformation of other organs.

Incomplete fusion of the vertebral bodies leads to the formation of a defect of the posterior wall of the spinal canal, which is clinically manifested as meningeal cysts. During clinical examination, one can often observe external signs of incomplete fusion, such as hyperigmentation of the skin in the area of the defect. 

Spina bifida may lead to a wide variety of diseases and several symptoms. These include permanent sacral pain, bedwetting, various sexual disorders, menstrual irregularities, chronic constipation, plano-valgus foot, varicose veins of the lower extremities, trophic ulcers and sweating of the feet. All these conditions can occur in the absence of spina bifida.

#### 2. Wedge-shaped vertebrae

This is a developmental anomaly in which the vertebra is a wedge-shaped bone mass of about half the size that it should be. The vertebra is located between two normal vertebrae. In the thoracic region, an additional unpaired rib often accompanies the wedge-shpaed vertebra. Rarely, the wedge-shaped vertebra is located with its base located posteriorly and its apex anteriorly (posterior wedge-shaped vertebra)

This type of deformity is easily diagnosed by a lateral radiograph. Other than the reduction in the size of the vertebral body, only the posterior part is intact and the anterior part is underdeveloped. This spinal anomaly is the cause of congenital angular or arcuate kyphosis.

The presence of one or more wedge-shaped vertebrae, located unilaterally, may cause varying degrees of lateral curvature of the spine. This is known as congenital soliosis. Scoliosis caused by wedge-shaped vertebrae, as opposed to static soliosis, is never of great significance. In cases in which the wedge-shaped vertebrae are located on both sides,one scoliosis could compensate for another. On clinical examination of these patients, external deformation of the spine is almost unnoticeable.

Patients with kyphosis and scoliosis typically suffer from spinal pain and dysfunctions of those organs the innervation of which has been impaired. The severity of the complaints depends on the degree of the deformity.

#### 3. Malformation of the vertebral bodies
This rather large group includes the following:
* Expansion of the diameter of the vertebral body (platispondylia) or flattened vertebrae.
* Shortening of the vertebral bodies (brachispondylia). Brachispondylia is clinically important because the shortening of the trunk leads to a reduction in height. When several vertebrae are affected, the decrease in height may be significant(10-12cm).
* A combination of expansion of the vertebral body and its flattening (platibrachispondilia). The butterfly deformity discussed earlier can be attributed to this type of anomaly.
* 'Fish vertebrae' (codfish vertebrae). In this deformity, the bertebral body has a biconcave appearance due to a varying extent of depression of the central part of the upper and lower borders of the vertebral body. The visible shape of the vertebral body does not change, but the upper and lower areas become saucer-shaped or concave. At the same time, the intervertebral discs become thicker, overswollen and biconvex.

The clinical manifestation of the anomalies mentioned above include skin diseases (dermatoses) of varying degrees of severity. These are characterized by thickening of the cornified layer of the epidermis. A common manifestation is ichthyosis, or fish skin disease, in which the skin becomes as thick as fish scales.

#### 4. Clefts in the interarticular space of the arch
In persons with spondylolysis, a defect of the vertebral arch, there is a cleft that is 2-3mm wide in the interarticular area.

Under certain conditions, spondylolysis can become the cause of complications, such as sliding of the vertebrae or spondylolisthesis. Therefore, spondylolysis is also referred to as 'prespondylolisthesis'. It is caused by the abnormal appearance of two points of ossification, instead of one, in each half of the vertebral arch. These two points do not merge with each other and the vertebral body thus gets separated from the arches, resulting in the formation of a cleft. Spondylolysis, which occurs in 10%-12% of all adults, is observed much more often than spondylolisthesis, and may be unilateral or bilateral. This anomaly is occasionally combined with spina posterior and hypoplasia of the spinous processes.

More than 80% of all patients with spondylolisthesis complain of lumbosacral pain, which may rediate to the lower extremities. Radiography is crucial for a definitive diagnosis.

#### 5. Anomalies of the lumbosacral region
During its development, the foetus has 7 cervical, 13 thoracic and 5 lumbar vertebrae. Then the first caudal (5th lumbar) vertebra fuses with the first sacral vertebra, and the 13th thoracic vertebra becomes the 1st lumbar vertebra after the reduction of the 13th pair of ribs. This process of transformation usually results in the formation of the normal number of vertebrae in the different regions of the spine. However, the process in certain permutations of the so-called transitional vertebrae. This is due to acquisition of the characteristics of the adjacent vertebrae.

update on 07.23

Variations is the number and size of the lumbosacral vertebrae, various types of fusion between them, etc. can be considered an anomaly. Extensive X-ray studies of this region have shown that a partocular antomical variation may be observed in 60%-75% of cases. It is not for no reasion that they say that the features of the lumbosacral regions are as unique to a person as is the face.

There is a condition in which the 5th (caudal) lumbar vertebra is modified and acquires the shape of a sacral vertebra. The development of this last lumbar vertebra may stop at any of the intermediate phases-from the normal lumbar vertebra to the true sacral vertebra. True sacralization refers to the complete bony fusion of the transverse processes of the 5th lumbar vertebra with the sacrum, as well as iliac synchondrosis. Incomplete sacralization refers to only an enlargement of the transverse process.

True sacralization is observed in 5%-7% of all cases. The enlargement of the transverse processes should be regarded as a normal anatomical variant, which occurs in about one-third of all patients. Sometimes, there is a combination of sacralization and spondylolisthesis. The opposite of sacralization is lumbarization of the sacral vertebra, a phenomenon observed less frequently. In order to establish the diagnosis of lumbarization, it must be conclusively proved that the number of sacral vertebrae is 4 rather than 5 and that there are 6 lumbar vertebrae.

Most patients with transitional vertebrae experience lumbar and sacral pain, ishchialgia, weakness in the muscles of the lower extremities, fatigue, cramps in the calf muscles, sweating of the feet, etc. Clinicians and radiologists are of the view that transitional vertebrae create some kind of a lumbosacral spine deficiency, which, however, is not always accomanied by pain.

In *Dr. Valentyn's* view, the idea that only bony structures are responsible for sacral pain is untenable. His team can gain a better understanding of the matter only if they improve ligamentous, articular, muscular and neural components functioning together. They thought they need to learn more about the static, mechanical and functional aspects. Considering all this, *Dr. Valentyn* felt that the surgical removal of an enlarged transverse process of a suprasacral vertebra would be undesirable.

In view of *S.A. Reinberg* , he re-emphasized an extremely important idea that anomalies are not in themselves the cause of pain. Rather, the pain is a consequence of certain pathological processes which result in complications of the anomalies.

#### 6. Mixed developmental anomalies of the spine

Congenital vertebral synostosis is the fusion of two or more vertebrae. In more than 2% of cases, it may be found in any region of the spine. It occurs most frequently between the 2nd and the 3rd, as well as the 6th and the 7th cervical vertebrae. The vertebral bodies, arches and , in some cases, processes may be knitted together.

The existence of various extensive synostoses in the cervical region is called Klippel-Feil syndrome or disease.  

(update on 07.26)

In this conditions, some of the cervical vertebrae- most often the lower vertebrae and sometimes the upper thoracic vertebrae may be fused together, forming a solia, poorly differentiated bony mass. The number of vertebrae and their height are, therefore, considerably reduced. The neck is shortened or even absent. Simultaneously, one shoulder blade or both may be higher than normal (Sperengel's deformity).

Although most of these anomalies are congenital,they usually come to the clinician's notice only when the patient is 40-60 years of age. The patient complains of local and reflected pain, stiffiness and limitied mobility of the head and neck, pain in the upper extremities (such as in plexitis), cramps in the fingers and their sweating, which is of great practical importance.

#### Transitional cranio-cervical border

The abnormalities observed in this region include assimilation and manifestation of the atlas. In assimilation, the lateral parts of the atlas, either on one side or both sides, as well as the arch are partially or completely fused with the occipital bone. The types of fusion are very diverse. In cases of assimilation, the atlas may shift anteriorly or laterally, or symmetrically or asymmertrically. This results in deformity and narrowing of the foramen magnum. In manifestation, the elements of the vertebra arise from the occipital bone.

In assimilation and manifestation, the odontoid process of the axis directly compresses the medulla oblongata, which contains the nuclei of the cranial nerves. For this reason, these pathological conditions can lead to serious neurological impairments. The complex of symptoms may be mistakenly interpreted as arising from amyotrophic sclerosis, syringobulbia, syringomyelia and other diseases of the medulla oblongata and the uppermost part of the SC. Though these anomalies are congenital, they are not apparent in the early stages of life. They often manifest in middle age and even old age.

----
#### Cervical ribs

Cervical ribs are relatively rare. They can be of considerable size and occasionally articulate with the first rib or manubrium sterni. This anomaly is usually asymmertrical.

In most cases, cervical ribs do not cause  pathological symptoms. Sometimes, a deformity is visible and is firm on palpation. Numbness of the fingers and neuropathic pain, such as that in plexitis, may develop. The vascular manifestations include coldness of the hand and weakening of the pulse. Cervical ribs may be associated with other abnormalities. When there are significant clinical disorders and symptomatic treatment is not effective, surgical removal of the cervical rib together with the periosteum is indicated.

#### Defects of vertebral parts

While performing their own anatomical investigations aimed to find the causes of vertebrobasilar syndrome, weakening of vision, migraine, visual field deficits and short-term loss of consciousness on suddenly turning the head (both among adults and children), author examined the vertebrae of many patients. Though we examined the vertebrae of different regions of the spine, cervical vertebrae were of special interest to him because the description in the literature of the anomalies in this region was clearly inadequate and the information given was also scanty.

An examination of the cervical vertebrae revealed that the transverse processes had some defects. In particular, in some cases, foramen transversarium was absent or was doubled. Moreover, the shape and size of the articular processes, as well as the size, location and degree of symmetry of the intervertebral joints varied a great deal. Such structural abnormalities, of course, led to violation of permeability of the vertebral artery and accordingly, induced circulatory disorders of the brain.

Concomitant deforming spondylosis, osteochondrosis and post-traumatic adhesion of the bodies and/or processes of the cervical vertebrae led to further potentiated circulatory disorders of the brain, neurological symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure. This situation could be associated with increased stenosis of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina due to deforming changes in the transverse processes and facet joints. However, in their view, the most significant negative factor leading to vertebral artery syndrome was the rotational displacement of vertebrae and, in particular, the cervical ones.
