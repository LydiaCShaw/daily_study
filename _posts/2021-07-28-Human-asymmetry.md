Look at the picture and observe the human faces, extensive research carried out that human faces are asymmetrical and most works of art also follow this rule, such as Venus de Milo. It is obvious that her face is different.

According to Henke, the asymmetrical facial features of the Venus de Milo probably are not the result of a conscious attempt by the artist. He made the portrait in a normal, realistic way depicting usual face structures. The realistic features of the Venus de Milo have made her more natural and human.

There is a clear evidence of asymmetry even when it comes to the size of the upper extremities. Following their studies on 5141 people, Hasse and Dehner found that in 75% of cases, the right arm is longer than the left. Asymmetry was evident not only in the length of the arms, but also in their circumference, owing to better development of muscles on the right side. As for the lower extremities, their findings were as follows:

In 75% of cases, the left limb was shorter than the right; in 18%, both extremities were practically of equal size; and in only 7%, the right limb was shorter than the left. A difference in the length of the left and the right limbs is a characteristic features even in newborns.

In functional terms, asymmetry of the upper limbs is apparent in the marked predominance of right-handedness over left-handedness. On an average, left-handers constitute 5% of adults. Asymmetry of the upper limbs has been observed even in the skeletons of Neanderthals. The presence of asymmetry in the length of the limb bones was observed in anthropomorphic apes.

There are reasons to believe that there is acertain asymmetry of the limbs even in mammals other than human beings, although the asymmetry in such cases is less pronounced. This is illustrated by the fact that animals, like human beings, move in circles when they lose visual control, as in foggy conditions. This is because of the functional predominance of the motor apparatus of one side of the body over that of the other side. In any cases, bilateral asymmetry of the motor apparatus is characteristic not only of humans, but also of all higher vertebrates.

#### Consulation
1. If the patient is  a child, he has usually been brought for consultation because of 
- [ ] scoliotic spinal deformity
- [ ] dizziness
- [ ] impaired vision
- [ ] impaired hearing
- [ ] impaired memory
- [ ] fatigue in the legs
- [ ] cramps in the calf muscles at night
- [ ] emotional lability
- [ ] sweaty hands or feets
- [ ] tendency to constipation and allergies
- [ ] bedwetting
 The number of complaints and their severity depend on the degree of deformation, age, skeletal anomalies, etc.
 2. Among adult patients, the usual complaints include
 - [ ] spinal pain in its various manifestations
 - [ ] in the backdrop of scoliotic posture
 - [ ] degenerative disc disease
 - [ ] spondylosis of varying degrees of severity
 - [ ] muscle pain
 - [ ] tightness in  the cervicothoracic region
 - [ ] fluctuations in the blood pressure
 - [ ] numbness and spasms of the fingers
 - [ ] retrosternal pain
 - [ ] shortness of breath
 - [ ] arrhythmia
 - [ ] extrasystoles
   
 Author's data on spinal deformities and spinal pain can be of great practical value, both for the enquiring patient and the ordinary physician. And, it has been observed that the clinical picture is the same in all individuals, regardless of age and sex. They have treated the youngest patient was two-and-a-half months old and the oldest, 89 years old.
 
 When it comes to the young patient, he was a child wh had just learnt to walk. He already had slight deformation of the chest, which could be felt even through his thin clothing. In the majority of cases the right scapula is protruding. When the child was placed in a prone position and his clothes were taken off, rotational displacement of the spinous processes of the 5th-7th thoracic vertebrae was clearly visible. The processes were located above and below the deformity. Similar curves were observed in the upper thoracic and lumbosacral regions.
 
 When examining infants, palpation of the spine shows that the overall width of the m.erector trunci varies substantially at the site of its attachment to the sacrum. In most casaes, the right part is wider than the left. According to Professor I.A.Movshovich(1964), this is not due to muscle hypertrophy but due to posterior  protrusion of the muscle, caused by deviation of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae as a result of torsion. This explanation is acceptable in the case of a person who is walking, but not in the case of one who is lying down. Also, it does not apply to babies, who cannot walk. How do muscle asymmetry and lateral cervature of the spine appear? What comes first - lateral curvature of spine or asymmetry, if any, between them?
 
 An interesting fact is that muscular asymmetry and spinal deformities are observed not only among infants but also among newborns. Does this mean that everything begins during intrauterine development? 
 
 The fact that this muscular asymmetry was always associated with lateral cervature of the spine is of great importance. Left-sided thoracic curvature was observed in cases in which the width of the left extensors was greater, the trunk curved in the opposite direction. Among children, the curvature of the trunk was manifested minimally, but it  progressed with age.
 
 Asymmetry of the trunk muscles and lateral curvature of the spine were observed among absolutely all patients and even among healthy people who did not have any complaints. In view of this, we believe that it is not unreasonable to suggest that the coexistence of asymmetry of the trunk muscles and lateral curvature of the spine is the law of nature. Also, these two features are often associated with a third one - spinal pain.
 
 It is not only one particular part of the trunk that is characterized by asymmetry. As mentioned earlier, it is typical of the whole body and can be clearly observed in the face as well as the pelvic area. From the frontal view, all individuals, regardless of nationality and without exception, have an asymmetrical face. If the reader wishes to notice the signs of asymmetry in the pelvic region, it is best to observed people during summer, when they are wearing thin clothes. Viewed from the posterior all people have a body asymmetry - one scapula protrudes more posterioely than the other, similarly there is a difference in the sizes of the buttocks.

### Origin of body asymmetry
 
 By now, we have seen that asymmetry of the body muscles and lateral curvature of the spine are present among all individuals, and that these are often associated with pain. We already know that spinal pain always appears with scoliotic deformity in the background. Therefore, it was logical to start searching for answers about their origin not in pain as a consequence, but in the initial cause of the lateral curvature of the spine. The development of spinal pain is preceded by the development of asymmetry of the trunk muscles. For this reason, I have raised some questions:
 
 * What causes asymmetry of the body?
 * How does lateral curvature of the spine develop?
 * What comes first - lateral curvature or muscle asymmetry?
 * What is the interrelation between them?

#### Anatomy and physiology of interhemispheric differences

In 1968, on the basis of a detailed post-mortem examination of the brain of 100 individuals, *Norman Geschwind and Walter Levitsky* reported significant anatomical differences between the hemispheres. In 65% of cases, the area of the temporal cortex, which overlaps the Wernicke's area, was greater in the left hemisphere(Group1), and only in 11% of cases was it greater in the right hemisphere(Group2). In 24% of cases, such interhemispheric differences were not observed(Group3).

In later years, the same researchers studied and measured hundreds of other postmortem brains. Their findings were similar to the earlier ones. In approximately 70% of cases, the planum temporale of the left hemisphere was significantly larger than that of the right. This asymmetry was characteristic of the brain of the foetus as well. 

*Stephen Wilson and Jenny Regan*, scientists from the University College of London, have also reported on asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres, as well as unequal distribution of functions between them, with the left hemisphere predominating.

It may be noted thay the right hemisphere controls the sensory and motor functions of the left side of the body, while the left controls those of the right side. In 95% of right-handed persons, the left hemisphere is responsible for language and speech, and it thus known as dominant. The right hemisphere controls skills associated with visual and spatial experience. It is called non-dominant.

The psychological research carried out by the authors mentioned above revealed other important details of the physiology of the brain. For example, it was shown that in most cases, women are superior th men in verbal skills but are inferior to them with respect to mathematical and spatial abilities. These differences are already noticeable in childhood. Girls begin to talk and read earlier than boys. Among children who are unable to read, the number of boys exceeds that of girls by four times.

The information obtained by author can be summarized as follows:
1. The left and right cerebral hemispheres are asymmetrical, a characteristic which is predetermined genetically.
2. In 95% of people who are right-handed, speech and language are controlled by the left hemisphere, while in the remaining 5% who are left-handed, they are controlled by the right hemisphere.
3. Broca's area is a specific part of the left fromtal lobe that controls all the muscles of the face, tongue, jaws and throat. This is achieved through connections of this area with the anterior central gyrus, the cortical area responsible for motor functions of the right side of the body. Broca's area can be called the motor centre for speech.
4. Wernicke's area, the posterior part of the first temporal gyrus, is responsible for semantic speech. In 65%-70% of cases, this area is larger in the left hemisphere.
5. Wernicke's and Broca's areas are interconnected by a fibrous tract that allows them to functions in a synchronized manner, ie. motor and semantic speech constitute a single process.
6. Taking into consideration the functional connection of Broca's area and Wernicke's area, one can assume that both of them function more actively in the left hemisphere than the right. This applies not only to the muscles of the head and neck but also to the spinal extensors. The asymmetrical contractile ability of the spinal extensors results in relative shortening of the left lower limb on the weaker side, as well as left-sided scoliosis of the trunk in the lumbar area. It is interesting to note that mimetic spasm is the cause of facial asymmetry.
7. Among those people(11%) in whom the planum temporale is more developed in the right hemisphere, hypertonus of the spinal extensors is greater on the left side, leading to a curvature of the body to the right. This results in relative shortening of the right leg.
8. In 24% of cases, the volume of the planum temporale is the same and, therefore, the face and other parts of the body should be symmetrical. However, the clinical observations have shown that this is doubtful, as there is no symmetry in nature. Thus, there is a need for physiologists to confirm the veracity of this information.
9. During the development of the male foetus, the growth of the left hemisphere is inhibited by the secretion of a high level of testosterone. In boys, such underdevelopment of the left hemisphere, particularly of Wernicke's area, explains why there are four times as many boys as girls among the population of childrenwho are unable to read, and why girls have better verbal skills than boys.
10. If we agree with the fact that Broca's and Wernicke's area are four times more active among girls than boys, it means that tonus of the spinal extensors, especially on the right side, is four times more pronounced among girls. Further, if the left hemisphere is smaller in boys than in girls, the difference in tone of the trunk muscles would incrase even more. This probably explains the universally known fact, which has been mentioned in the literature, that lateral scoliotic curvature occurs 5-6 times more frequently among girls than boys.
11. As the newborn grows, asymmetry of the trunk muscles get imprinted in the cerebellum, which controls all movements. Indeed, the cerebellum is called the keeper of conditioned reflexes. The conditioned reflex that keeps the vertical body position develops from the time when a child takes her or his first steps, and then during the following months when the child becomes capable of standing in a stable upright posture and walking steadily.
12. In girls, this process occurs faster than in boys, which is why they begin to walk earlier. However, unfortunately, this conditioned reflex - let author call it vicious - preserves the wrong body posture, either leaning to the right or to the left. This is how a child enters life and this is how he remains in all subsequent periods of his life, unless he meets a competent orthopaedic surgeon.
   
 That is why anatomists consider body curvature to be normal. In fact, it is characteristic of all individuals.
 
 Thus, it may be said that asymmetry of the body occurs due to certain features ot the development of the brain, and begins to develop as early as the foetal stage. Newborns have asymmetry of the trunk muscles. Later, when they begin to walk, different degrees of tension of the spinal extensors on the two sides lead to the formation of a lateral curvature of the spine, which should  be called a physiological scoliotic posture.
 
 The degree od inclination of the body and the transition from the physiological to the pathological state depends both on the tone of the trunk extensors and the structural features of the spine, which in most cases are genetically determined. In the situation which has been described, that we do not consider a variety of specific and non-specific pathological processes that may affect the structure of the musculoskeletal system.
 
 The preceeding information suggests that during the intrauterine period up to birth, it is only the cerebral mechanism that is responsible for lateral curvature of the spine. However, after birth, other than cerebral factors are involved as well.
