## Basic Principles
Repetitive Transcranial magnetic(rTMS), one of the effective neuromodulation therapy, is a classic approach on the treatment of central nervous or peripheral nervous system diseases.

The mechanism of rTMS is electromagnetic induction.When doctors activate the generator, there is a constantly changing current in coil produces a magnetic field oriented orthogonal to the plane of the coil. 
Since the skull is an insulator, there is almost no attenuation when the pulsed magnetic field penetrates. 
And then, this field passes through the cerebral cortex area, generating a localized current in brain that stimulate nerve cells of target area which causes a change in transmembrane leading to depolarization or hyperpolarization of neurons so that they would be more or less excitable (Klomjai, W. et al.,2015). 
## Effects of rTMS
There are some factors affecting rTMS: intensity, duration,frequency,stimulation site and coil types.
Firstly, Insufficient intensity may be useless, however, overdosing has been proved that results some side effects such as fainting, seizures, headache, etc. Duration depends on multiple diseases and its severity. 
When it comes to frequency, we often define the high frequency is above 1 Hz which makes brain more excitable; low frequency is less than 1 Hz which makes brain less excitable. 
Some articles proposed that, rTMS can increase or decrease the excitability of the corticospinal tract which affects cortical firing. This kind of cortical firing can provoke or inhibit the brain function depending on the excitability of interneurons (Qiu, C et al.,2019). Apparently, it has been proved that the excitability of interneurons is depend on frequency.

 Interneurons exist in the cortical area of the brain. One is excitatory interneuron such as glutamatergic neuron that emits excitatory neurotransmitter; the other is inhibitory interneuron such as GABAergic neuron that emits inhibitory neurotransmitter. These two different types of interneurons have different electrophysiological properties which means high or low stimulation frequency makes them release neurotransmitter with high or low concentration affecting brain functions.

Researchers may study these interneurons and finally determine the frequency used in rTMS. For example, the GABAergic interneurons, stimulations with low frequency might increase the efficacy of GABAergic inhibitions, because the stimulations did not change the firing rates of GABAergic interneurons but decreased the firing rates of pyramidal cells which belong to a kind of excitatory neurons. 
However, stimulations with high frequency increased both of them, and increase of excitatory neurons is higher than that of GABAergic neurons, therefore, stimulation of high frequency can provoke cortical firing. 
Therefore, by studying electrophysiological properties of interneurons, authors often define the high frequency is above 1 Hz (in clinical, doctors tend to use 5 Hz in most of case). Low frequency is less than 1 Hz which inhibit cortical firing.
We all know that different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions. Therefore, stimulating different site with high or low frequency can achieve some therapeutic effect.

For example, the figure A demonstrated is a research of depression. Some authors contributed a network of prefrontal regions involved in the pathophysiology of depression (Downar, J et al., 2013). By using PET-MRI, authors can figure out different function area and observe the abnormal activity of depression as shown in figure B. These function network are marked in different colors and the red one means abnormal part.
It is generally believed that in in clinic, the left prefrontal cortex is under-excited and the right one is over-excited (Kim, T. D. et al.,2019). Doctors tend to use 10 Hz at LDLPFC and less than 1Hz at RDLPFC to treat patients.
Meanwhile, the stimulation site can reach deeper area which impact motor cortex and cerebellum so that it can control the legs or pelvic floor, which means it has potential in peripheral nervous system. As figure D shown, the stimulation lead to depolarize and produce an action potential. If used in the primary motor cortex, the muscle activity can be recorded on electromyography referring to as a motor evoked potential (Nojima et al.,2018).

In order to satisfy different stimulation site, multiple types of coil have be produced. The circular coil originally used firstly. Subsequently, figure-8 coil was developed to satisfy more focal pattern of activation. Now, this kind of coil has commonly and commercially used in hospital. Four-leaf coil involved more areas can stimulate peripheral nerves. Double-cone coil is more comfortable because of its shape. As for H-core and crown, they can generate deeper magnetic penetration, so that they are utilized to deeper areas of brain even can control legs (Deng, Z. D et al.,2014).Therefore, rTMS is available for both central nerves and peripheral nerves system. It can not only use in some psychiatry and neurology diseases, but also use in relieving the pain and rehabilitation of stroke including motor and language function.
## Application and treatment areas
rTMS can be used in multiple diseases, especially in psychiatry and neurology, it has proposed relatively mature treatment methods. 
For example, anxiety is generally considered to be caused by hyperfunction of the right prefrontal cortex, and it is usually treated with low-frequency rTMS. Epilepsy is caused by the excitement of the cerebral cortex, also used low frequency rTMS. On the contrary, patients with PTSD need to be treated with high frequency rTMS (usually 10 Hz) at RDLPFC.
More importantly, rTMS can be used to treat some diseases for elder people for its non-invasion. For example, Alzheimer’s, stroke, insomnia are common in older people. For patients with motor impairment after stroke, the affected side is used high frequency, the conterlateral side is used low frequency. Therefore, 0.6Hz and 10Hz stimulation are used at RDLPFC or LDLPFC respectively.
