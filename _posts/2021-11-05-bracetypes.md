A scoliosis curve usually does not improve without surgery. However, studies have shown that wearing a back brace as prescribed can often prevent the progression of scoliosis. As such, wearing a brace can be an effective way to keep a scoliosis curve’s Cobb angle relatively small and manageable.

A scoliosis curve that is 50 degrees by the time an adolescent reaches skeletal maturity (about age 14 or 15 for girls and 16 or 17 for boys) will continue to progress throughout adulthood.

These types of curves are likely to become a severe deformity that requires surgery. Therefore, the goal of bracing is to avoid a major surgery by either stopping curve progression altogether or at least preventing it from reaching 40 or 50 degrees at the time of skeletal maturity.

There are several rigid back braces available on the market today to treat scoliosis. These braces can vary in how pressure is applied to the spine and ribs to prevent a scoliosis curve from progressing.

### Classification

Some rigid braces require full-time wear, which is typically between 16 and 23 hours a day, whereas others are only worn about 8 to 10 hours per night while sleeping. So that is the difference between full-time brace and part-time brace.

The part-time brace mainly includes Nighttime Brace.This type of brace puts greater forces on the spine while worn during sleep to make up for not wearing the brace during daytime hours. 

Since the nighttime brace is only worn while laying down (sleeping), it can apply greater force on the spine by not needing a counterbalance to keep the head aligned over the hips for walking or other movements.

Another classification is determined by the cover region of brace. For example, the most common brace we used is a kind of TLSO brace.

##### TLSO Brace

TLSO represents Thoracic-Lumbar-Sacral Orthosis brace,  the relatively snug-fitting TLSO braces start beneath the shoulders and are considered low-profile braces because they can be discreetly worn beneath loose-fitting clothes.

##### CTLSO Brace

Another type of brace models do exist,CTLSO(Cervical-Thoracic Lumbar-Sacral Orthosis, TLSO with a neck extension) for a high thoracic curve.

The first cervico-thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis (CTLSO), called the Milwaukee brace, was invented in the 1940s. While this brace was innovative at the time, it was bulky and included metal bars up to the neck. The Milwaukee brace was uncomfortable to wear and also brought unwanted attention (especially for teenagers trying to fit in with peers).

Few patients benefited from this brace because few were willing or able to wear it anywhere near the prescribed 23 hours per day, therefore, until now, they are not as common.



### Some common braces

#### Full-time Brace

##### Boston Brace

The most-commonly prescribed brace for scoliosis today is the Boston brace.

A Boston brace is typically made from one of several prefabricated mold options. After the orthotist (person making the brace) selects the mold that best fits the patient’s size and curve type, corrective pads and trim lines (cutouts) are strategically added to the brace by following a blueprint specific to the patient’s scoliosis curve.

The Boston brace works by applying corrective pressure on the convex (outer) side of the curve and cutting out corresponding areas of relief on the concave (inner) side of the curve so the spine can migrate in that direction.

The brace opens in the back, so the patient may need help getting into and out of it.

##### Wilmington Brace

Another common TLSO is the Wilmington brace. However, unlike the Boston brace, the Wilmington brace is custom-fitted based on a cast taken of the patient while lying down, facing up. After the cast is made, corrective forces specific to the patient’s spinal curve are added before the brace is completed.

This brace goes onto the body similar to a tight jacket and is known as a full contact TLSO due to its lack of gaps or open spots.

##### Milwaukee Brace

The Milwaukee brace, which is the original cervico-thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (CTLSO) invented in the 1940s, is an older and bulkier brace. Due to the effectiveness and relative convenience of today’s more modern braces, the Milwaukee brace is rarely used anymore. However, it is still sometimes used for curves higher in the thoracic or cervical spine.

In theory, both the Wilmington brace and Boston brace are effective full-time bracing options for scoliosis curves at T8 (mid-back or bottom of the shoulder blade) or lower. Sometimes a clinic has experience with the Boston brace or Wilmington brace, but not both, and that could determine which full-time brace is prescribed.


#### Nighttime Brace

##### Charleston Bending Brace

The most commonly-prescribed nighttime brace is the Charleston bending brace. It is custom-fitted based on a cast taken of the patient’s torso. After the cast is created, corrective forces are added to the brace based on readings from the spine’s x-ray.

The Charleston bending brace is intended to be worn by laying down, not while up and moving. As such, the brace is able to apply stronger forces and is not restricted by considerations for the head to remain balanced over the pelvis.

In addition to applying lateral forces to push the curve closer to the back’s midline, the Charleston bending brace also applies pressure to bend and holds the spine in an overcorrected position. While it would be unrealistic for someone to be bent so far to the side while trying to go about the day, this extreme position can be held relatively easily at night while laying down and sleeping.

##### Providence Brace

Similar to the Charleston brace, the Providence brace applies a hypercorrective force on the spine that is only feasible while laying down and sleeping at night. However, instead of bending the spine’s curve in the opposite direction like the Charleston brace, the Providence brace slightly elevates one shoulder and directly applies lateral and rotational forces on the curve (or both curves if it is a double curve).

The Providence brace is capable of pushing the curve toward the midline or beyond in some cases.

Sometimes physicians have more experience with either the Charleston bending brace or Providence brace, and have a personal preference for prescribing one or the other.


##### Choosing Full-Time vs. Nighttime Bracing

While full-time bracing and nighttime bracing have both been proven to be effective treatment options for scoliosis, the science is not settled regarding which is better.

Some studies show that the more time a person spends in a brace, the more likely the scoliosis curve’s progression will be stopped. However, other studies indicate that nighttime bracing could be better because patients are more likely to adhere to its simpler protocol.

In general, today’s doctors tend to favor full-time bracing for curves that are at least 35 degrees or for double curves. For single curves that are less than 35 degrees, nighttime bracing could be an option, especially if the patient expresses a preference for it.

Even though rigid bracing has been the standard in nonsurgical treatment of scoliosis for many decades, some controversy continues regarding its efficacy. Some in the medical community claim that rigid bracing is not more effective than observation or perhaps other treatments, such as soft braces and/or exercises, are better.

Below is an explanation for why current data back rigid bracing as the most effective nonsurgical treatment for stopping the progression of a scoliosis curve.

#### Why Bracing Has Been Hard to Prove
Here are some key reasons why some controversy has lingered regarding whether or not bracing for scoliosis works:

1. Few random control trials. 
   
   While numerous scientific studies have shown trends that rigid bracing lowers the risk for a scoliosis curve to progress, most of them were small studies and not randomized. Without a random control group, the findings are considered weaker and do not meet the most rigorous of scientific standards.
2. There are some good reasons more studies about scoliosis bracing do not include random control trials.
    For one, few parents would be willing to let a random decision decide their child’s scoliosis treatment. Another reason is if a certain treatment method is already considered superior—in this case bracing for scoliosis—there are some ethical considerations involved with purposely allowing some patients to receive an inferior treatment or no treatment at all.
3. Patients inaccurately report brace adherence. 
   For many decades, every scientific study about scoliosis bracing relied on patients (or their parents) to report how many hours per day they were wearing the brace. However, many patients either exaggerated how many hours they were wearing the brace or simply struggled with tracking the hours accurately. As such, many studies that supposedly failed to find benefits of bracing were probably filled with people who claimed to be wearing the brace as prescribed when in fact they were not. Newer technologies today can use heat sensors to track how many hours a patient is in the brace, so studies are getting more accurate data on the efficacy of bracing.
4. Wrong brace design or usage. 
   While probably less common today, there have been cases where a brace did not fit or was designed wrong from the start for the patient. There have also been cases where a patient might not have been wearing the brace tight enough or the brace kept coming loose without the patient realizing it (such as when sleeping).
5. Bracing does not work for everyone. 
   Even if the bracing is done as prescribed, there are cases where bracing simply does not work. The reasons for this are not fully understood, but experts suspect that some curves—especially those that start in early childhood—are simply more likely to progress.
   
#### Rigid Braces More Effective Than Soft Braces

One big drawback of a rigid brace is that it is uncomfortable to wear. Many adolescents—and sometimes their parents—reject the idea of wearing a hard brace even if they believe it works. As such, researchers and companies have attempted to meet the demand for a soft brace to treat scoliosis.

Soft braces are made of a somewhat flexible fabric and a series of tight straps that cross the body, such as from the crotch and hips, over the shoulders, and around the torso in various directions.

While soft braces are marketed as being an effective and more comfortable alternative to rigid braces, the scientific data to date does not back that assertion. In one case, a study showing limited effectiveness for soft braces had to later be retracted because one of the authors did not adequately disclose a connection to a soft brace company.

#### Exercise Cannot Replace Bracing

There is some disagreement within the medical community as to whether special exercises, such as physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE), can reduce the need for rigid bracing and/or surgery. While some research indicates there have been cases where specific exercises have reduced the size of a curve, the evidence thus far is scientifically weak.

Current recommendations are that exercise is good for keeping the back strong and flexible regardless of whether scoliosis is present. If a scoliosis curve is at risk of progressing, it is fine to try an exercise program under the guidance of a medical professional. However, rigid bracing should still be the primary treatment option if the curve is either already progressing rapidly or at least 25 degrees.
