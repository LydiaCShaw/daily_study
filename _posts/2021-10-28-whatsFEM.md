It seems that I have not updated for one month. Sorry for the late update, although I know the mainly reader is myself, I have to apologize to myself for my lazy. I know the most of time in October is very busy, school screening, assessment, scolioscan and clinic... I did a lot of work in this month but none of them belong to myself research study or my own work,  I also know this is just an excuse. So just be quick and let us start my topic now.

What is FEM? It will be a very important point for me especially it will be my mainly research proposal when it comes to the coming 2022 seminar.

According to the explaination of Wiki,

```
The finite element method (FEM) is a widely used method for numerically solving differential equations arising in engineering and mathematical modeling. Typical problem areas of interest include the traditional fields of structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid flow, mass transport, and electromagnetic potential.
```


```
The FEM is a general numerical method for solving partial differential equations in two or three space variables. To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts that are called finite elements. This is achieved by a particular space discretization in the space dimensions, which is implemented by the construction of a mesh of the object: the numerical domain for the solution, which has a finite number of points. The finite element method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of algebraic equations. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain. The simple equations that model these finite elements are then assembled into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem. The FEM then approximates a solution by minimizing an associated error function via the calculus of variations.
```
May be you can not truely understand the Differential equation specifically but you still can use this method.

## Mimics Medical

Mimics (Materialise's Interactive Medical Image Control System) is Materialise's software for processing images such as from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to construct 3D models, which can then be directly linked to rapid protoping, CAD, surgical simulation and advanced engineering analysis.


A stack of images can be loaded into the software, Mimics, and this usually consists of images in the XY(axial) plane. Mimics then calculates and creates images in the XZ(coronal) and YZ(sagittal) direction. This enables a more comprehensice 3D feel of the 2D data.

The key to converting anatomical data from images to 3D models is a process called segmentation. During segmentation the user indicates the structures of interest in the sliced image data. This information is then used to recreate a 3D model from the segmented structures. To describe the outer surface of the 3D model, Mimics uses the STL format, which is the common file format in RP. The STL format allows describing the most complex geometries accurately. This is necessary, since anatomical data is in general very intricate. Accurate segmentation is important in order to extract meaningful information from images.

Therefore the first thing if we want to use this software, we need to prepare some raw data which includes axial, coronal and segittal image of CT or MRI and it would be better if the format is Dicom.

Of course, micro-CT, bitmap, TIFF and JPEG files can also be imported in mimics.

Just like the following folder store all the dicom images of patient but it is just for one case.We need a lot of memory to store the dataset.

### STL file explnation

An STL file is a triangulated surface mesh file. The file contains the three nodes of each triangle and defines the normal direction of the triangle. This file format is ideal for anatomical geometry because of its simple file structure and flexibility to match any contour desired. It is not controlled by parametric constraints such as true CAD files and IGES files.  The specific explanation and manual can view on [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yousof_Mohandes2/post/can_anyone_suggest_me_any_appropriate_resources_for_Learning_MIMICS_and_3Matic/attachment/59d635f579197b80779936d2/AS:386294329954307@1469111153848/download/Mimics+Student+Edition+Course+Book.pdf)

When I learned Digital image processing in University, I knew these words, Thresholding, Region Growing, Morphology Operations, and they will use in mimics using this principle.

Normally, I often use thresholding operation to obtain a rough mask. Afterwards, using split mask, the mainly steps in FEM often keep every spine alone, therefore, I need to split all the spine to several masks.

As the image below, it requires check the spine mask one by one by editing four operation windows. Mimics allow us edit mask in coronal view, sagittal view and transverse view, also, one can edit the mask in 3D model window as well.

Editing these images one by one can make the mask more accurate to real patient, most importantly, we should make sure there are no any holes inside the mask, or else, the next program will show some errors.

Meanwhile, we are also sure the masks are not overlap, for example, after we finish the masks of L1 and L2, we can use the Boolean Operations so that it can scuessfuly run in ABAQUS.

After editing the mask, we can click 'calculate part' to construct one part that can export to .stl file. At that time, some 3D tools are also available to use after finishing the calculation. It will look better after using smooth.

## Geomagic

Geomagic includes a lot of different version, for example, there are Geomagic Wrap, Geomagic Design X, Geomagic Studio, Geomagic Control and Geomagic Qualify. All of them have different functions.

The image below is the operation window of Geomagic Wrap, I ever saw some Youtuber and Bilibili upper used it in tutorial. Also, some upper used Geomagic Design X as well, my supervisor recommend me to used it too.

The operation window of Design X really looks well. We mainly used some functions such as Healing Wizard, Smart Brush, Fill Holes, Enhance Shape, Global Remesh, etc. under the polygons manu which are very useful.

After using Healing wizard and global remesh, the grid looks nicer than before. Afterwards, the most imoortant step is using auto surface under the Exact surfacing manu. Then, a silver moldel will display under the solid bodies section. When we right click this, one can export a .igs file that will be used in ABAQUS.

## ABAQUS

ABAQUS is a very useful software. It provides some functions that allows users input different kinds of properties and force to analyze the biomechanics.

At present, I just finished one section of Spine and tried to practice to know the whole process of the research. The next stage, it will be more and more Spine section added into the ABAQUS and it will be available to do some biomechanics analyze.
