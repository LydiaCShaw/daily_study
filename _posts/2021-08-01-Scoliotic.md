Scoliosis as a disease is considered one of the most difficult areas of orthopaedics. As the eminent German orthopaedist *A.Schantz* said, spinal diseases are among the most obscure areas of pathology. The problem of scoliosis has been, and remains, a subject of keen interest in all orthopaedic clinics in the world.

The first precise description of scoliosis was given by *Ambroise Paré* (1510-1590), the famous French surgeon who was also the first to propose treating the condition with a cast made of perforated plates that immobilize the chest. *Hippocrates* knew of scoliosis and placed it the category of serious disorders that significantly shorten the life of a patient. This problem was stuided thoroughly in the early medieval period. He treated scoliosis with respiratory gymnastics, singing and bandaging the chest. He is the one who coined the terms scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. *Glisson, Fabricius and Hildanus* used medical gymnastics and various devices for treatment.

### Anatomical and physiological features of the spine in scoliosis

The human spine consists of 24 vertebrae (excluding the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae), which are more or less firmly interconnected with each other as I mentioned before [in this article](http://linjingshang.top/cssoliosis.html). Seven of them are cervical, 12 thoracic and 5 lumbar. Twelve pairs of ribs(7 pairs of true and 5 pairs of spurious ribs) are connected with 12 vertebrae. The pairs of true ribs are connected with the sternum frontally, the 8th-10th pairs meet anteriorly to form the costal arch, and the 11th-12th pairs end freely without connection to the sternum.

The 24 vertebrae and the discs are surrounded by a framework of dense ligaments and together, these form a strong pillar that supports the body. Despite the fact that the vertebrae are held together very tightly. As a result, the whole spine is characterized by a certain degree of fliexibility. This can be increased significantly through exercise, such as in the case of acrobats, gymnasts and circus performers. Bending forward, backwards and sideways, as well as lateral rotation, are known to increase the flexibility of the spine.

The spine is not straight and has bends, which are considered merely physiological as long as they are within certain limits and are located in the frontal plane. The following curvatures of the spine are recognized: anterior curvature of the cervical spine(lordosis), posterior curvature of the thoracic spine(kyphosis),lumbar lordosis and finally, kyphosis of the sacrociccygeal region.

Let us now discuss the reasons for the formation of these physiological curvatures, which are not present in a newborn. As long as a baby is in the prone position, the entire spine forms a stright line. The spine bends backwards during the initial attempts to sit up. Once the child  begins to stand or walk systematically, the posterior convex curvature is replaced by the curvatures described above.

In the caudal region of the spine, the sacral bone, which rests between the two iliac bones, is not free to move, while the rudimentary tailbone ends freely. While sitting, the body rests on three points on the tubera ischii and coccyx(rear sitting) or on the tubera ischii and lower surface area on which the spine resets is adequate for it to support itself and, therefore, it does not require balancing. Both in children and adults, when sitting, the spine is in a vertical position in the case of those who are not tired, and forms a single convex arch in the case of those who are in a state of fatigue.

When standing or walking, the conditions are different. The spine no longer has the three points of support and must depend on only one point, located in the middle of an imaginary line connecting the two hip joints. The situation is further complicated by the fact that this point is located in front of the spine; thus if a person tries to get up and follow his center of gravity, he would fall forward. 

The entire upper body would be bent and would fall forward due to the vertical position of the pelvis and the fact that  the joints between the sacral and iliac bones are not mobile if there is no flexion of  the lumbar spine. It is only due to the formation of lumbar spine curvature (lordosis) that lumbar spine flexion is possible. The process of development of this curvature occurs at two more points. The upper part of the body would become too heavy and fall backwards were it not for a kyphotic curvature,  if we did not ben the head and neck forward, these three physiological curvatures serve a purpose. They are necessary to move the pivot point on the sheer line. These physiological curves are formed during the first two years of life.

As for the kyphotic configuration of the sacrum, it probably makes for optimal location of the large and small pelvis,besides facilitating childbearing function in women.

Apart from the fact that these physiological curvatures are a necessity, they also have an aesthetic value. It is because of these curvatures that the spine and, therefore the back, form a winding line that lends beauty to the structure of a normally built individual. Of course, such beauty is possible only if the degree of the curves is moderate. Curvatures that are too pronounced or too weakly accentuated should not be considered physiological but pathological. Also, curvatures should not be considered normal if they are not located in the frontal plane and if the spine forms at least one slight lateral curvature. Then it becomes scoliotic or kyphoscoliotic curvature of the spine. A more pronounced posterior curvature in the thoracic region is known as accentuated kyphosis (slouching), and when this is combined with accentuated lordosis (forward curvature), it is termed 'roundback'

The preceding sentences might seem to imply that the distinction between physiological and pathological spinal curvature is based on the concept of beauty and, therefore, the whole question of scoliosis is matter of aesthetics.However, it is known that the development of forms and expendiency are closely linked. In the case of spinal deformities,pathological formations not only lack beauty, but are also not expedient and, in some cases, are even dangerous to the life and health of an individual. Dealing with scoliosis is, therefore, not only a problem of asethetics, but is also extremely important from a medical point of view. Other than attempting to keep the beauty of the human body intact, a physician's aim is to protect people from serious illness and premature death.

### Asymmetry of the trunk

During clinical examination of a patient with scoliosis, it is the asymmetry of the body that first draws one's attention. Usually, the primary reason for which parents visit an orthopaedic surgeon is that they have noticed asymmetry of the trunk in their child.

The features of the deformities of the trunk depend on the location of the curvatures of the spine and their number. Thus, in scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine, there is a marked inclination of the head towards the concave side; the shoulder girdles are at different levels and the contours of the neck are asymmetrical. In the case of a single curvature in the thoracic spine, the distance between the shoulder blades and the spinous processes remains almost the same on both sides, and their lower angles are located at the level of one pair of ribs. Thus, in a solitary thoracic spinal curvature, the position of the arc of the shoulder blades is symmetrial.

*Right-sided thoracic scoliosis; inferior angles of scapulae are located at the level of 7th pair of ribs and at the same distance from the spinous processes (negative 'symptom of scapular positioning'), A. Patient Photo,B. Plain Radiograph

Two adjacent curvatures in the thoracic region give reise to asymmetry, with the shoulder blades being loacted at different levels relative to the vertical line that may be drawn though the spinous processes of the 7th cervical vertebra. Analysing the mechanism of the asymmetrical positioning of the shoulder blades, *I.A.Movshovich* concluded that the rhomboid and trapezius muscles play the main role in such cases. It was this author who proposed and described the 'symptom of shoulder blades positioning'. Looking out for this symptom is of great importance in the clinical examination of patients with scoliosis.

*Superficial muscles of the spine in S-shaped scoliosis; on the convex side of thoracic and lumbar curvatures of the spine, bulging of muscles is observed which is caused by typical deformation of the spine and ribs*

In second- and sometimes first-degree lumbar scoliosis, a muscular cushion is formed on the convex side of the curvature. This is the so-called 'Chaklin symptom' which indicates the presence of torsion of the spine due to a change in the volume of the m.erector spinae. Curvature of the lumbar spine also leads to flattening of the waistline on the convex side of the curvature and the waistline becomes more pronounced on the concave side. Sometimes a transverse line is formed.

As in the lumbar region, a muscle ridge is also formed on the convex side of the thoracic curvature resulting in torsion of the spine, but the formation of the rib hump masks this cushion. How do we explain the emergence of a 'massive' m.erector spinae on the convex side of the curvature? Should it be seen in terms of muscular hypertrophy or should it be considered a mechanical protrusion caused by the underlying bony structures? Morphological studies of the trunk muscles by I.A.Movshovich showed that there is a degenerative process. Thus, the bulging of the muscle is a result of torsion of the lumbar vertebrae and posterior deviation of the transverse processes.

*Positioning of paravertebral muscles on convex and concave sides of lumbar curvature; on the convex side, muscle stands out against the underlying bone due to torsion of vertebrae - the muscular cushion is formed. 1- spinous process, 2 and 8- m.erector spinae; 3 and 7- m.quadratus lumborum; 4 and 6- m.psoas major; 5-vertebral body*

 The obligatory condition for the identification of this symptom is symmetrical positioning of the legs. Bending and rotation of the body are also related to the functioning of the m.erector spinar, as well as of the m.psoas major and m.quadratus lumborum.

*Position and functional axis of m.psoas major in lumbar and thoracolumbar scoliosis. A- in lumbar scoliosis unilateral muscle contraction on the convex side increases torsion of the spine and increases the degree of lumbosacral curvature. B-in thoracolumbar scoliosis unilateral muscle contraction on the concave side reduces curcature of the spine.*

*Position of m.quadratus lumborum(1,4) and lig.iliolumbale(2,3) in left-sided lumbar scoliosis (scheme)*

According to I.A.Movshovich, asymmetry of the trunk muscles is a result of torsion of the vertebrae. This explanation is acceptable in the case of adult patients, but not in the case of children, especially infants.It wounld be useful to refer to the question 'Anatomy and physiology of interhemispheric differences' that [mentioned before](http://linjingshang.top/Human-asymmetry.html), which describes how asymmetry of the spinal extensors is associated of the brain. It is possible that the cerebral mechanism responsible for asymmetry of the spinal extensors is prevalent in early childhood. As an individual gets older, torsion of the vertebrae (spinal mechanism) occurs, resulting in the formation of a muscular cushion.
