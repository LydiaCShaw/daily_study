## Two types of scoliosis
First type: This type was characterized by anteposition of the right collarbone (clavicle) and marked asymmetry of the left half of the chest, as well as anteposition of the left costal arch. There was a rib hump at the back on the same side of the chest that had a clavicle deformation.
Second type: in the case of anteposition of the left clavicle, all the features of the first type of deformity of the chest were mirrored on the opposite side.
Generally speaking, right-sided scoliosis is usually more frequently observed among right-handed persons and left-sided scoliosis  among left-handed persons.According the dataset of doctor *Valentyn* ,almost all the patients examined had shortening of the left leg and accordingly, right-sided (type 1) scoliosis. Shortening of the right leg and accordingly, left-sided scoliosis were present only in rare cases.
## Symptom 

### Shortening of the lower limb

On the side of the chest where the arc of the ribs came forward, there was a clearly visible shortening of the lower limb.

How to measure the length of lower limb?

It is considered more precise to determine the length of the lower limb by measuring its two segments separately. The first segment runs from the lower edge of the greater trochanter to the knee joint (thigh length), while the second is from the knee joint to the bottom of the outer ankle, which is the length of the tibia. This method of measurement is called absolute or anatomical.
Tape measurement do not yield accurate data especially among obese people.
### Varus deformity
On the side on which the lower limb was relatively shortened, the lower third of the thigh and tibia had a marked varus deformity. Varus deformity of the lower limb occured mainly on the left (83-85% of cases) and less frequency on the right.
### Volume of buttocks
Meanwhile, on the side of varus deformity, the volume of the buttocks was significantly smaller than the opposite side.
### Muscles of back
For people who has shorterning leg, the volume of both muscles becomes much larger on the right than that on the left.There are also limitations in the rotation of the head in the direction of the leg that was relatively shortened.

Patients with severe scoliosis apart from showing such a decrease in the volume of one buttock, suffered from hypoplasia  of the pelvic bones.A possible explanation for this situations is  that shortening for  the leg since early childhood had caused a gradual increase of working hypotrophy in all soft or bone tissues.

Functional hypotrophy of the gluteal muscles on the side of the shortened leg can be clearly observed even among children of 4-5 years of age. Two more features become noticeable among children of 10-12 years of age.
① There is a delay of the pelvis and ② there is a marked decrease in the volume of soft tissues of the thigh and crus on the side of the shortened leg.
Functional scoliosis is associated only with lateral curvature of the spine, while, actual or structural scoliosis consists not merely of a distortion, but also a rotation of the spine about its axis of wedge-modified vertebrae.

##  Anatomical aspects of the problem
Vertebral column: The vertebral column(VC) consists of separate vertebrae, which are interconnected by intervertebral discs, joint and ligaments. The number of vertebrae varies between 32 and 35, and in rare cases, reaches 37 due to a larger number of sacral and coccygeal vertebrae. The VC includes 7 cervical vertebrae (vertebrae cervicales), 12 thoracic vertebrae (vertebrae thoracicae) and 5 lumbar vertebrae (vertebrae lumbales).
