## Two types of scoliosis
The first type: This type was characterized by anteposition of the right collarbone (clavicle) and marked asymmetry of the left half of the chest, as well as anteposition of the left costal arch. There was a rib hump at the back on the same side of the chest that had a clavicle deformation.

The second type: in the case of anteposition of the left clavicle, all the features of the first type of deformity of the chest were mirrored on the opposite side.

Generally speaking, right-sided scoliosis is usually more frequently observed among right-handed persons and left-sided scoliosis  among left-handed persons.According the dataset of doctor *Valentyn* ,almost all the patients examined had shortening of the left leg and accordingly, right-sided (type 1) scoliosis. Shortening of the right leg and accordingly, left-sided scoliosis were present only in rare cases.
## Symptom 

### Shortening of the lower limb

On the side of the chest where the arc of the ribs came forward, there was a clearly visible shortening of the lower limb.

How to measure the length of lower limb?

It is considered more precise to determine the length of the lower limb by measuring its two segments separately. The first segment runs from the lower edge of the greater trochanter to the knee joint (thigh length), while the second is from the knee joint to the bottom of the outer ankle, which is the length of the tibia. This method of measurement is called absolute or anatomical.

Tape measurement do not yield accurate data especially among obese people.
### Varus deformity
On the side on which the lower limb was relatively shortened, the lower third of the thigh and tibia had a marked varus deformity. Varus deformity of the lower limb occured mainly on the left (83-85% of cases) and less frequency on the right.
### Volume of buttocks
Meanwhile, on the side of varus deformity, the volume of the buttocks was significantly smaller than the opposite side.
### Muscles of back
For people who has shorterning leg, the volume of both muscles becomes much larger on the right than that on the left.There are also limitations in the rotation of the head in the direction of the leg that was relatively shortened.

Patients with severe scoliosis apart from showing such a decrease in the volume of one buttock, suffered from hypoplasia  of the pelvic bones.A possible explanation for this situations is  that shortening for  the leg since early childhood had caused a gradual increase of working hypotrophy in all soft or bone tissues.

Functional hypotrophy of the gluteal muscles on the side of the shortened leg can be clearly observed even among children of 4-5 years of age. Two more features become noticeable among children of 10-12 years of age.

① There is a delay of the pelvis and ② there is a marked decrease in the volume of soft tissues of the thigh and crus on the side of the shortened leg.

Functional scoliosis is associated only with lateral curvature of the spine, while, actual or structural scoliosis consists not merely of a distortion, but also a rotation of the spine about its axis of wedge-modified vertebrae.

##  Anatomical aspects of the problem
Vertebral column: The vertebral column(VC) consists of separate vertebrae, which are interconnected by intervertebral discs, joint and ligaments. The number of vertebrae varies between 32 and 35, and in rare cases, reaches 37 due to a larger number of sacral and coccygeal vertebrae. The VC includes 7 cervical vertebrae (vertebrae cervicales), 12 thoracic vertebrae (vertebrae thoracicae) and 5 lumbar vertebrae (vertebrae lumbales). 

The VC of an adult male has four curves. The upper cervical curve, which is convex in the forward direction, is formed by all the cervical and *upper thoracic vertebrae*. The peak of the curve is located at the level of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae.The peak of the *second thoracic curve*, which is concave in the backward direction, is located  at the level of the 6th and 7th thoracic vertebrae. The lower thoracic and all lumbar vertebrae form the *third lumbar curve*. Anteriorly, the most prominent lumbar vertebrae, the 4th and 5th, and the most prominent sacral vertebra, the 1st, form the promontorium. The sacrum and coccyx form the *fourth curve*, which is concave in the backward direction.

### Spinal motion segment
A spinal motion segement(SMS), also known as a 'functional spinal unit', which is the smallest physiological motion unit of the spine to exhibit biomechanical characteristics similar to those of the entire spine.A FSU consists of two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disc and all adjoining ligaments between them and excludes other connecting tissues such as muscles. The three-joint complex that results is sometimes referred to as the "articular triad".

A thoracic SMS also includes the costovertebral and costotransverse joints.

Generally, all vertebrae have a similar structurem but they acquire certain features depending on the region of the spine. Thus, except the 1st cervical vertebra, all vertebrae have a vertebral body, which is located anteriorly, and a vertebral arch, which is located posteriorly.

#### Cervical vertebrae
Cervical vertebrae  are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull. Truncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals) lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. In sauropsid species, the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. In lizards and saurischian dinosaurs, the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. The vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes.

#### Thoracic vertebrae
Thoracic vertebrae compose the middle segment of the vertebral column, between the cervical vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae.In humans, there are twelve thoracic vertebrae and they are intermediate in size between the cervical and lumbar vertebrae; they increase in size going towards the lumbar vertebrae, with the lower ones being a lot larger than the upper.They are distinguished by the presence of facets on the sides of the bodies for articulation with the heads of the ribs, as well as facets on the transverse processes of all, except the eleventh and twelfth, for articulation with the tubercles of the ribs. By convention, the human thoracic vertebrae are numbered T1–T12, with the first one (T1) located closest to the skull and the others going down the spine toward the lumbar region.

#### Lumbar vertebrae
The lumbar vertebrae are, in human anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. They are the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body (as found only in the thoracic region). They are designated L1 to L5, starting at the top. The lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the body, and permit movement.

#### Sacrum
The sacrum (plural: sacra or sacrums), in human anatomy, is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine that forms by the fusing of the sacral vertebrae (S1–S5) between ages 18 and 30.

The sacrum situates at the upper, back part of the pelvic cavity, between the two wings of the pelvis. It forms joints with four other bones. The two projections at the sides of the sacrum are called the alae (wings), and articulate with the ilium at the L-shaped sacroiliac joints. The upper part of the sacrum connects with the last lumbar vertebra (L5), and its lower part with the coccyx (tailbone) via the sacral and coccygeal cornua.

The sacrum has three different surfaces which are shaped to accommodate surrounding pelvic structures. Overall it is concave (curved upon itself). The base of the sacrum, the broadest and uppermost part, is tilted forward as the sacral promontory internally. The central part is curved outward toward the posterior, allowing greater room for the pelvic cavity.

In all other quadrupedal vertebrates, the pelvic vertebrae undergo a similar developmental process to form a sacrum in the adult, even while the bony tail (caudal) vertebrae remain unfused. The number of sacral vertebrae varies slightly. For instance, the S1–S5 vertebrae of a horse will fuse, the S1–S3 of a dog will fuse, and four pelvic vertebrae of a rat will fuse between the lumbar and the caudal vertebrae of its tail.

The Stegosaurus dinosaur had a greatly enlarged neural canal in the sacrum, characterized as a "posterior brain case”.

#### Coccyx
The coccyx , commonly referred to as the tailbone, is the final segment of the vertebral column in all apes, and analogous structures in certain other mammals such as horses. In tailless primates  since Nacholapithecus , the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail. In animals with bony tails, it is known as tailhead or dock, in bird anatomy as tailfan. It comprises three to five separate or fused coccygeal vertebrae below the sacrum, attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint, the sacrococcygeal symphysis, which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx.

[2]The thoracic vertebrae were historically called dorsal vertebrae; cf. Especially due to the free copying of old public domain versions of Gray's Anatomy, the old term may still be encountered, however the old term is long obsolete and misleading, as the dorsum refers to the whole back and not just the thoracic part of the back.
