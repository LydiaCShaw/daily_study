## Two types of scoliosis
The first type: This type was characterized by anteposition of the right collarbone (clavicle) and marked asymmetry of the left half of the chest, as well as anteposition of the left costal arch. There was a rib hump at the back on the same side of the chest that had a clavicle deformation.

The second type: in the case of anteposition of the left clavicle, all the features of the first type of deformity of the chest were mirrored on the opposite side.

Generally speaking, right-sided scoliosis is usually more frequently observed among right-handed persons and left-sided scoliosis  among left-handed persons.According the dataset of doctor *Valentyn* ,almost all the patients examined had shortening of the left leg and accordingly, right-sided (type 1) scoliosis. Shortening of the right leg and accordingly, left-sided scoliosis were present only in rare cases.
## Symptom 

### Shortening of the lower limb

On the side of the chest where the arc of the ribs came forward, there was a clearly visible shortening of the lower limb.

How to measure the length of lower limb?

It is considered more precise to determine the length of the lower limb by measuring its two segments separately. The first segment runs from the lower edge of the greater trochanter to the knee joint (thigh length), while the second is from the knee joint to the bottom of the outer ankle, which is the length of the tibia. This method of measurement is called absolute or anatomical.

Tape measurement do not yield accurate data especially among obese people.
### Varus deformity
On the side on which the lower limb was relatively shortened, the lower third of the thigh and tibia had a marked varus deformity. Varus deformity of the lower limb occured mainly on the left (83-85% of cases) and less frequency on the right.
### Volume of buttocks
Meanwhile, on the side of varus deformity, the volume of the buttocks was significantly smaller than the opposite side.
### Muscles of back
For people who has shorterning leg, the volume of both muscles becomes much larger on the right than that on the left.There are also limitations in the rotation of the head in the direction of the leg that was relatively shortened.

Patients with severe scoliosis apart from showing such a decrease in the volume of one buttock, suffered from hypoplasia  of the pelvic bones.A possible explanation for this situations is  that shortening for  the leg since early childhood had caused a gradual increase of working hypotrophy in all soft or bone tissues.

Functional hypotrophy of the gluteal muscles on the side of the shortened leg can be clearly observed even among children of 4-5 years of age. Two more features become noticeable among children of 10-12 years of age.

① There is a delay of the pelvis and ② there is a marked decrease in the volume of soft tissues of the thigh and crus on the side of the shortened leg.

Functional scoliosis is associated only with lateral curvature of the spine, while, actual or structural scoliosis consists not merely of a distortion, but also a rotation of the spine about its axis of wedge-modified vertebrae.

##  Anatomical aspects of the problem
![imageline](.\assets\img\posts\20210716\vertebral_lines.jpg)

Vertebral column: The vertebral column(VC) consists of separate vertebrae, which are interconnected by intervertebral discs, joint and ligaments. The number of vertebrae varies between 32 and 35, and in rare cases, reaches 37 due to a larger number of sacral and coccygeal vertebrae. The VC includes 7 cervical vertebrae (vertebrae cervicales), 12 thoracic vertebrae (vertebrae thoracicae) and 5 lumbar vertebrae (vertebrae lumbales). 

The VC of an adult male has four curves. The upper cervical curve, which is convex in the forward direction, is formed by all the cervical and *upper thoracic vertebrae*. The peak of the curve is located at the level of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae.The peak of the *second thoracic curve*, which is concave in the backward direction, is located  at the level of the 6th and 7th thoracic vertebrae. The lower thoracic and all lumbar vertebrae form the *third lumbar curve*. Anteriorly, the most prominent lumbar vertebrae, the 4th and 5th, and the most prominent sacral vertebra, the 1st, form the promontorium. The sacrum and coccyx form the *fourth curve*, which is concave in the backward direction.

### Spinal motion segment
A spinal motion segement(SMS), also known as a 'functional spinal unit', which is the smallest physiological motion unit of the spine to exhibit biomechanical characteristics similar to those of the entire spine.A FSU consists of two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disc and all adjoining ligaments between them and excludes other connecting tissues such as muscles. The three-joint complex that results is sometimes referred to as the "articular triad".

A thoracic SMS also includes the costovertebral and costotransverse joints.

Generally, all vertebrae have a similar structurem but they acquire certain features depending on the region of the spine. Thus, except the 1st cervical vertebra, all vertebrae have a vertebral body, which is located anteriorly, and a vertebral arch, which is located posteriorly.

#### Cervical vertebrae
Cervical vertebrae  are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull. Truncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals) lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae.

The vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes.

#### Thoracic vertebrae
Thoracic vertebrae compose the middle segment of the vertebral column, between the cervical vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae.In humans, there are twelve thoracic vertebrae and they are intermediate in size between the cervical and lumbar vertebrae; they increase in size going towards the lumbar vertebrae, with the lower ones being a lot larger than the upper.They are distinguished by the presence of facets on the sides of the bodies for articulation with the heads of the ribs, as well as facets on the transverse processes of all, except the eleventh and twelfth, for articulation with the tubercles of the ribs. By convention, the human thoracic vertebrae are numbered T1–T12, with the first one (T1) located closest to the skull and the others going down the spine toward the lumbar region.

#### Lumbar vertebrae
The lumbar vertebrae are, in human anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. They are the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body (as found only in the thoracic region). They are designated L1 to L5, starting at the top. The lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the body, and permit movement.

#### Sacrum
The sacrum (plural: sacra or sacrums), in human anatomy, is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine that forms by the fusing of the sacral vertebrae (S1–S5) between ages 18 and 30.

The sacrum situates at the upper, back part of the pelvic cavity, between the two wings of the pelvis. It forms joints with four other bones. The two projections at the sides of the sacrum are called the alae (wings), and articulate with the ilium at the L-shaped sacroiliac joints. The upper part of the sacrum connects with the last lumbar vertebra (L5), and its lower part with the coccyx (tailbone) via the sacral and coccygeal cornua.

The sacrum has three different surfaces which are shaped to accommodate surrounding pelvic structures. Overall it is concave (curved upon itself). The base of the sacrum, the broadest and uppermost part, is tilted forward as the sacral promontory internally. The central part is curved outward toward the posterior, allowing greater room for the pelvic cavity.

In all other quadrupedal vertebrates, the pelvic vertebrae undergo a similar developmental process to form a sacrum in the adult, even while the bony tail (caudal) vertebrae remain unfused. The number of sacral vertebrae varies slightly.

#### Coccyx
The coccyx , commonly referred to as the tailbone, is the final segment of the vertebral column in all apes, and analogous structures in certain other mammals such as horses. In tailless primates  since Nacholapithecus , the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail. In animals with bony tails, it is known as tailhead or dock, in bird anatomy as tailfan. It comprises three to five separate or fused coccygeal vertebrae below the sacrum, attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint, the sacrococcygeal symphysis, which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx.

### Spinal muscles
![image9](.\assets\img\posts\20210716\ef.png)
Extension of the spine: This is performed by muscles located on the posterior surface of the trunk and the neck. These muscles are: the trapezius muscle superior and inferior serratus muscles, splenius cervicis and capitis muscles, extensor spinae, transversospinal muscle and short muscles of the back.

Flexion of the spine: This is performed by the anterior cervical muscles, like the sternocleidomastoid or sternomastoid muscle, the scalene muscles and the longus capitis and colli muscles; the abdominal muscles and the iliopsoas muscle.

Rotation of the spine: The unilateral contraction of the following muscles allows for the rotation of the spine about its longitudinal axis: the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the superior part of the trapezius muscle, the scalene muscles and the abdominal external oblique muscle of the opposite side. Circular movements of the spine are performed due to sequential contraction of all muscle groups.

### Ligamentous apparatus of the spine
The vertebrae are interconnected by fibrous cartilaginous plates or discs, with intervertebral joints and ligaments. The ligaments play a variety of roles, such as strengthening the spine by limiting its mobility. Intervertebral discs are located between the bodies of all the vertebrae, except C1-Cii. The discs have the functions of providing support, fixation, and shock-absorption. They also provide some mobility to the SMS. The outer side of the disc, called the annulus, consists of densely interwoven collagen fibres that grow into the periosteum. These fibres protect the horizontal surfaces of the vertebral bodies from traumatization by providing a strong interconnection between the disc and the bodies of the adjacent vertebrae. Fibres become completely calcified by the end of the second decade of life.

There are no fibres in the center of the disc which, instead, contains a jelly-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. It is soft, glassy in appearance and has the tendency to protrude.

The discs of the cervical SMS are more or less of the same height. Those in the thoracic region are very thin. The height of the lumbar discs is greater than that of the others, and reach the maximum in the Liv-Lv segment.

### Vascular supply to the spine
The cervical region of the VC is supplied mainly by the vertebral artery. Arising from the subclavian artery, it passes through holes in the transverse processes of six cervical vertebrae, sending out branches to the spinal cord and medulla oblongata.

In the thoracic region of the VC, arterial trunks arise from the intercostal arteries. At the level of the costal heads, each of these arteries divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branches run forward between the internal and external intercostal muscles, supplying these muscles and the skin. The posterior branches run backward, supplying the muscles and skin of the back.

There are four pairs of lumbar arteries, which correspong to the intercostal arteries. These, too, are divided into anterior and posterior branches. They send branches to the vertebral canal. The middle sacral artery, running down to the coccyx, sends out branches to the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae.

There are numerous veins in the VC and these are arranged in plexuses that lie along the spine, on its outer and inner surfaces. There are both anterior and posterior and inferior vena cava via posterior branches. Vertebral veins, together with the spinal nerves, run through the intervertebral foramina.

### Central nervous system
The central nervous system(CNS) consists of parts that are located within the cranium and the VC.

Brain: The supreme organ of the nervous system, the brain, regulates the interaction of the organism with the environment, as well as the body's functions.

Spinal cord: The spinal cord(SC), or medulla spinalis, and brain are genetically, morphologically and functionally interconnected. There is no sharply defined border between the two, with one running into the other.

The SC is located within the spinal canal, from the 1st cervical vertebra to the 1st lumbar vertebra or the upper margin of the 2nd lumbar vertebra. To some extent, it curves together with the parts of the VC that it passes through. At the level of the lower margin of the foramen magnum and the upper margin of the 1st cervical vertebra, the SC runs into the medulla without any sharply defined borders. The SC only partially fills the cavity of the vertebral canal.

### Peripheral nervous system
A living organism is a unique system that is capable of controlling itself. This is achieved through the input of information by neural receptors, followed by central processing of the information and the transfer of signals to the periphery. The PNS is the structural basis for the input and transfer of information. The afferent or sensory nerves transfer information from the periphery to the spinal and cerebral centres, while the efferent or motor nerves transfer signals from the center to the periphery.

Distally from the cranial or spinal ganglia, sensory and motor fibres form mixed nerves. Peripherally, they are interwoven with each other, thus exchanging fibres. Such a network of intersecting nerves is called a neural plexus.

On the basis of their topographical features, the peripheral nerves are divided into cranial nerves (12 pairs), spinal nerves (31 pairs), and vegetative (autonomic) nerves. Cranial nerves are anatomically linked mainly with the brainstem, in which their nuclei are located. These nerves originate from the base of the brain. Spinal nerves are paired into symmetrical nerves trunks. They consist of the following:
* Cervical nerves, or nn.cervicales(C1-C7) 8 pairs
* Thoracic nerves, or nn.thoracici(Th1-Th12) 12 pairs
* Lumbar nerves, or nn.lumbales(L1-L5) 5 pairs
* Sacral nerves, or nn.sacrales(S1-S5) 5 pairs
* Coccygeal nerve, or n.coccygeus(Co1-Co2) 1 pair
 
The spinal nerves are mixed, that contain sensory as well as motor fibres. As each nerve leaves the spinal canal, it almost immediately divides into a branch that contains motor and sensory fibres. The trunk of a spinal nerve is connected with the corresponding ganglion of the sympathetic chain through the rr.communicantes.

Adjacent anterior and posterior branches of the spinal nerves merge to form nerve plexi at different levels: cervical, brachial, lumbosacral and coccygeal.

Cervical plexus: The cervical plexus innervates all the tissues and organs of the neck at the level of the upper four cervical vertebrae(C1-C4). It consists of the following branches:
* Lesser occipital nerve, or n.occipitails minor(Cii-Ciii)
* Great auricular nerve, or n.auricularis magnus(Ciii-Civ)
* Transverse cervical nerve, or n.transversus colli(Cii-Ciii)
* Supraclavicular nerves or nn.supraclavicularis(Ciii-Civ)
* Phrenic nerve or n.phrenicus(Ciii-Civ-Cv)
 
 Brachial plexus: The brachial plexus innervates all the tissues and organs of the neck at the level of the lower cervical vertebrae and of the upper limbs. It is formed by anterior branches of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th cervical spinal nerves. The BP is divided into supra- and infra-clavicular parts, and consists of the following:
 * Muscular branches
 * Dorsal scapular nerve, or n.dorsalis scapulae(Cv)
 * Long thoracic nerve, or n.thoracicus longus(Cv-Cvii)
 * Subclavian nerve, or n.subclavius(Civ-Cvi)
 * Suprascapular nerve, or n.suprascapularis(Cv-Cvi)
 * Musculocutaneous nerve, or n.musculocutaneus(Cv-Cvii)
 * Lateral pectoral nerve, or n.pectoralis lateralis(Cv-Cviii,Thi)
 * Medial pectoral nerve, or n.pectoralis medialis(Cv-Cviii)
 * Ulnar nerve, or n.ulnaris(Cvii-Cviii)
 * Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve or n.cutaneus antebrachii medialis(Cviii,Thi)
 * Medial brachial cutaneous nerve or n.cutaneus brachii medialis(Cviii,Thi,Thii,Thiii)
 * Median nerve or n.medianus(Cvi-Thi)
 * Radial nerve or n.radialis(Cv-Cviii,Thi)
  
  Thoracic nerves: These nerves innervate the organs of the thoracic cavity. The anterior branches of the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal spinal nerves(Li-Lv,Si-Sv,Coi-Coii) merge to form a single lumbosacral plexus. Topographically, this plexus is divided into lumbar(Thxii,Li-Liv) and sacral and large pelvis, and the lumbar part of the trunk.
  
  Lumbar plexus: The lumbar plexus consists of the following:
  * Muscular branches
  * Iliohypogastric nerve or n.iliohypogastricus(Thxii-Li)
  * Ilioinguinal nerve, or n.ilioinguinalis(Li)
  * Genitofemoral nerve, or n.genitofemoralis(Li,Lii)
  * Lateral cutaneous femoral nerve, or n.cutaneus femoris lateralis(Lii-Liii)
  * Obturator nerve or n.obturatorius(Li-Lv)
  * Accessory obturator nerve or n.obturatorius accessorius(Lii-Liv)
  * Femoral nerve or n.femoralis(Li-Liv)

Sacral and coccygeal plexi: These plexi innervate the organs of the small and large pelvis, as well asa the sacrum. They include nerves, or nn.sacrales(Si-Sv,Liv-Lv:Si-Siii)

The sacral plexus consists of the following:
* Internal obturator nerve, or n.obturatorius internus(Si)
* Nerve to piriformis, or n.pirifoemis(Si-Sii)
* Nerve to quadratus femoris, or n.quadratus femoris(Si-Sii)
* Superior gluteal nerve, or n.gluteus superior(Liv-Lv,Si)
* Inferior gluteal nerve, or n.gluteus inferior(Lv,Si,Sii)
* Posterior cutaneous femoral nerve, or n.cutaneus femoris posterior(Si-Sii)
* Sciatic nerve, or n.ischiadicus(Liv,Lv,Si-Siii)

Coccygeal Plexus: The coccygeal plexus innervates the organs of the small pelvis, the coccyx and the sacrum, and consists of the following branches:
1. Coccygeal nerve, or n.coccygeus
2. Anococcygeal nerves, or nn.anococcygei

[2]The thoracic vertebrae were historically called dorsal vertebrae; cf. Especially due to the free copying of old public domain versions of Gray's Anatomy, the old term may still be encountered, however the old term is long obsolete and misleading, as the dorsum refers to the whole back and not just the thoracic part of the back.
