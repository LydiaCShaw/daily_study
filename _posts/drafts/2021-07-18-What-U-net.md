## What is U-net?
The u-net is convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images especially useful in biomedical images segmentation. Up to now it has outperformed the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. It has won the Grand Challenge for Computer-Automated Detection of Caries in Bitewing Radiography at ISBI 2015, and it has won the Cell Tracking Challenge at ISBI 2015 on the two most challenging transmitted light microscopy categories by a large margin.
### U-net
![imageunet](.assets\img\posts\20210718\cover.png)
*U-net architecture (example for 32x32 pixels in the lowest resolution). Each blue box corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. The number of channels is denoted on top of the box. The x-y-size is provided at the lower left edge of the box. White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations.*

The structure of U-Net is shown in the figure. The left side can be regarded as an encoder, and the right side can be regarded as a decoder.

The encoder has four sub-modules, each of which contains two convolutional layers. After each sub-module, there is a down-sampling layer implemented by max pool. 

The resolution of the input image is 572x572, and the resolutions of modules 1-5 are 572x572, 284x284, 140x140, 68x68 and 32x32 respectively. Since the convolution uses the valid mode, the resolution of the next sub-module here is equal to (resolution of the previous sub-module -4)/2. 

The decoder contains four sub-modules, and the resolution is sequentially increased by upsampling until it is consistent with the resolution of the input image (because the convolution uses the valid mode, the actual output is smaller than the input image).

The network also uses a skip connection to connect the up-sampling result with the output of the sub-module with the same resolution in the encoder as the input of the next sub-module in the decoder.
