Recently, I am very grateful and excited to receive the letter of appointment from Dr. M.S. Wong. That's why the renewing frequency of my blog is slower than before. For my engineering background, I still have a lot of things to learn. Therefore, in this article, I want to summerize and illustrate some new things.


### Assessments
Scoliosis can be observed by body asymmetry such as uneven shoulders, shoulder blade, thoracic hump, loin depression or pelvic tilt. In severe cases, appearance and cardiopulmonary function could also be affected. Observation of the body shape and contour is a simple method to assess the potential of having scoliosis, which may indicate the need for further investigations while it would be difficult for mild scoliosis as those subtle changes may not be noticeable.

In our group, we mainly detect whether children have uneven shoulder and shortening leg. But firstly, 
* step 1, we would give them basic body measurements such as height,weight, arm span and calculate the BMI.

* Afterwards, step 2, A.C.T. Pelvic Level would be used to detect wheter they have pelvic tilting.

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\pelvic.jpg)
The A.C.T. Pelvic Level can be the clinician’s most valuable tool for quick and accurate assessment of leg length discrepancies. You can find that there is a small bubble in the middle in picture above. 

Leg length imbalance is determined by pressing the expandable wings of the tool onto the crest of the pelvic bones. It is very sensitive, if both sides are uneven, the bubble will move to the higher side. So when you get a detection, if you found the bubble is on the right hand side, which means the leg of the right direction for you (the left direction for patient) is longer and right lower limb is shorter. At that time, we may record the shorten one, so I should be careful, and record the same one with the direction of bubble.

* step 3, there are some different types of wood boards, 2mm, 3mm, 5mm, 10mm 15mm... If patient has uneven pelvic, we may ask him to step on the plank, elevating the short limb until the bubble on the level is centered. 

Leg length discrepancies are very common in the population but often not diagnosed. The A.C.T. Pelvic Level quickly and accurately determines if the pelvis is horizontally in plane. By shimming up the short limb, a measurement for determining the amount of correction can be determined. 

As a screening tool, the A.C.T. Pelvic Level can help the practioner to quickly screen patients for a condition which may indicate an anatomic or functional leg length discrepancy.

Before this, some authors have used the measurement tool of the diagram below.

Compare it with A.C.T, I have to admit that A.C.T is better so it insteads the former steadily.

* step 4, once the bubble on the level is centered, we may record the thickness of the plank. Afterwards, patients need to step on the plank and finish the trunk listing.

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\trunklisting.jpg)

As the image shown, we have a laser source. We align the laser source at the midline of the patient's hip, and then record the distance of the laser source at the same level as the C7.

After recording the result of trunk listing, Adam's forward bend test is arranged then. We normally use scoliometer and spinescan two kinds of tools to measure the ATR/ATI (Angle of Trunk Rotation/Inclination).

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\adam_test_eng.png)

* step 5, we ask patients to do the Adam's forward bend test, using scoliometer. Side-bending may also require to assess rotational flexibility. If ATI is above 5°, we should arrange ultrasound or other imaging test for further assessment.


The scoliometer is shown below, that has a range from 0 to 30 degree on both sides. There is also a small ball in the middle. However, be careful, if you notice that the small ball is 15 ° to the right, whcih means, the patient's spine is low on the right and the spine is tilted to the left. Therefore, the reverse is required when recording, such as 'Lt Lumbar 15°'. 

Afterwards, we also measure side-bending using scoliometer to assess the flexibility. If the spine is flexible, when patient bends to right, the 'Lt lumbar 15°' would reduce, on the contrary, patient bends to left, the curve would increase. By detecting the flexibility of the spine, we can determine whether the patient will have a considerable effect when wearing the brace.

* step 6, we also use SpineScan to measure the ATI. SpineScan requires patient not only do the Adam's forward bending but also standing position. It would scan twice.

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\spinescan_procedure_eng.jpg)
SpineScan is an android application based on cell phone. As the image shown below, it consists two parts: cell phone and the mechine underneath and it can be used bluetooth to connect to the cell phone.

* step 7, after measuring the ATI, if the degree is above 5, then, the ultrasound assessment would be arranged. If the angle measured above 8° in school screening, we will notify his or her parents and lead the child to the laboratory for further testing.

The mainly ultrasound devices we often use are ScolioScan and ScolioScan Air. It also has a relative software based on Windows system called ScolioStudio to obtain the three-dimentional structure by reconstructing the ultrasound image. 

If we are in school or some organization for screening, we often use ScolioScan Air because it is portable and convinent so that we can carry it out to the school easily.

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\scolioscan_air.jpg)

As the image shown above, it consists of a probe and a Microsoft Surface Laptop that installed the software (not ScolioStudio). The probe is special and different from the normal probe, which has Optical correction. It should be noted that there can not be any other moving objects in the direction facing the side of the camera during scanning. Otherwise, the test will fail. When the room is very dark, the scan results will be poor as well.

* step 8, when the patient come to our lab, parents should sign some files which means they accept our AIS project that funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club. At that time, we may repeat the previous detection process (step 1-6) and use the ScolioScan (big mechine).

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\Scolioscanbig.jpg)

As the image shown above, it is bigger than ScolioScan Air, and its scanning results are more accurate. The following are the comparison for the scan results of the two devices.

![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\compare.jpg)
Before we operate the ScolioScan, we should locate four points: upper point (higher than C7), lower point (lower than L5), C7 and L5. Meanwhile, the scan speed should be approximately 1mm/s or else the image will be poor.

After scanning, we can use auto/manual two choices to measure the angle. The images shown below are two different methods. Auto choice can display complete curve and maximum angle. Manual choice requires us to draw tangent lines to the most inclined part of the curve.

We also installed the ScolioStudio, however, we still explore the funtion now. It has so many windows and requires operator adjusts every points manually, afterwards, the 3D structure would change simultaneously.

* step 9, if the angle is above 8, X-ray assessment would be arranged. Afterwards, Cobb's angle would be measured.
 
 Adam's forward bending test is screening golden standard, and Cobb's angle is clinic golden standard. Both of them are very important. 
 ![image](.\assets\img\posts\20210826\X-raycases.jpg)
 
 In our project, Cobb's angle≤10°, we would observe temporarily.
 
 Cobb's angle is between11- 20°, which is belong to mild case, they require regular exercise and regular follow up to monitor the curve development.
 
If the Cobb's angle is between 21-45°, which is belong to Moderate case, orthoses and physiotherapy are required. 

The Severe case is above 45°,then these patients need referring out for further consultation or a surgical treatment.

More specific protocol is as shown below.

Meanwhile, we also have a software that can calculate PMC and Cobb's angle.
