Scoliosis as a disease is considered one of the most difficult areas of orthopaedics. As the eminent German orthopaedist *A.Schantz* said, spinal diseases are among the most obscure areas of pathology. The problem of scoliosis has been, and remains, a subject of keen interest in all orthopaedic clinics in the world.

The first precise description of scoliosis was given by *Ambroise Par√©* (1510-1590), the famous French surgeon who was also the first to propose treating the condition with a cast made of perforated plates that immobilize the chest. *Hippocrates* knew of scoliosis and placed it the category of serious disorders that significantly shorten the life of a patient. This problem was stuided thoroughly in the early medieval period. He treated scoliosis with respiratory gymnastics, singing and bandaging the chest. He is the one who coined the terms scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. *Glisson, Fabricius and Hildanus* used medical gymnastics and various devices for treatment.

### Anatomical and physiological features of the spine in scoliosis

The human spine consists of 24 vertebrae (excluding the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae), which are more or less firmly interconnected with each other as I mentioned before [in this article](http://linjingshang.top/cssoliosis.html). Seven of them are cervical, 12 thoracic and 5 lumbar. Twelve pairs of ribs(7 pairs of true and 5 pairs of spurious ribs) are connected with 12 vertebrae. The pairs of true ribs are connected with the sternum frontally, the 8th-10th pairs meet anteriorly to form the costal arch, and the 11th-12th pairs end freely without connection to the sternum.

The 24 vertebrae and the discs are surrounded by a framework of dense ligaments and together, these form a strong pillar that supports the body. Despite the fact that the vertebrae are held together very tightly. As a result, the whole spine is characterized by a certain degree of fliexibility. This can be increased significantly through exercise, such as in the case of acrobats, gymnasts and circus performers. Bending forward, backwards and sideways, as well as lateral rotation, are known to increase the flexibility of the spine.

The spine is not straight and has bends, which are considered merely physiological as long as they are within certain limits and are located in the frontal plane. The following curvatures of the spine are recognized: anterior curvature of the cervical spine(lordosis), posterior curvature of the thoracic spine(kyphosis),lumbar lordosis and finally, kyphosis of the sacrociccygeal region.

Let us now discuss the reasons for the formation of these physiological curvatures, which are not present in a newborn. As long as a baby is in the prone position, the entire spine forms a stright line. The spine bends backwards during the initial attempts to sit up. Once the child  begins to stand or walk systematically, the posterior convex curvature is replaced by the curvatures described above.

In the caudal region of the spine, the sacral bone, which rests between the two iliac bones, is not free to move, while the rudimentary tailbone ends freely. While sitting, the body rests on three points on the tubera ischii and coccyx(rear sitting) or on the tubera ischii and lower surface area on which the spine resets is adequate for it to support itself and, therefore, it does not require balancing. Both in children and adults, when sitting, the spine is in a vertical position in the case of those who are not tired, and forms a single convex arch in the case of those who are in a state of fatigue.

When standing or walking, the conditions are different. The spine no longer has the three points of support and must depend on only one point, located in the middle of an imaginary line connecting the two hip joints. The situation is further complicated by the fact that this point is located in front of the spine; thus if a person tries to get up and follow his center of gravity, he would fall forward. 

The entire upper body would be bent and would fall forward due to the vertical position of the pelvis and the fact that  the joints between the sacral and iliac bones are not mobile if there is no flexion of  the lumbar spine. It is only due to the formation of lumbar spine curvature (lordosis) that lumbar spine flexion is possible. The process of development of this curvature occurs at two more points. The upper part of the body would become too heavy and fall backwards were it not for a kyphotic curvature,  if we did not ben the head and neck forward, these three physiological curvatures serve a purpose. They are necessary to move the pivot point on the sheer line. These physiological curves are formed during the first two years of life.

As for the kyphotic configuration of the sacrum, it probably makes for optimal location of the large and small pelvis,besides facilitating childbearing function in women.

Apart from the fact that these physiological curvatures are a necessity, they also have an aesthetic value. It is because of these curvatures that the spine and, therefore the back, form a winding line that lends beauty to the structure of a normally built individual. Of course, such beauty is possible only if the degree of the curves is moderate. Curvatures that are too pronounced or too weakly accentuated should not be considered physiological but pathological. Also, curvatures should not be considered normal if they are not located in the frontal plane and if the spine forms at least one slight lateral curvature. Then it becomes scoliotic or kyphoscoliotic curvature of the spine. A more pronounced posterior curvature in the thoracic region is known as accentuated kyphosis (slouching), and when this is combined with accentuated lordosis (forward curvature), it is termed 'roundback'

The preceding sentences might seem to imply that the distinction between physiological and pathological spinal curvature is based on the concept of beauty and, therefore, the whole question of scoliosis is matter of aesthetics.However, it is known that the development of forms and expendiency are closely linked. In the case of spinal deformities,pathological formations not only lack beauty, but are also not expedient and, in some cases, are even dangerous to the life and health of an individual. Dealing with scoliosis is, therefore, not only a problem of asethetics, but is also extremely important from a medical point of view. Other than attempting to keep the beauty of the human body intact, a physician's aim is to protect people from serious illness and premature death.
