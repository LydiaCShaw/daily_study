## Abstract
  During the lecture, I benefited a lot from this course. Next, I will illustrate the context following four aspects. The first part will include history of immunity and organ transplantation including early scientists' breakthroughs in organ transplants, and what their stories inspired me. The second part, I will illustrate some immune rejection, including types of immune rejection, and measures to avoid. Subsequently, I will talk about some recent research regarding the method that avoiding immune rejection and finally I will give a discussion and summary.

## Immunity History

  In early 18 century, the body was seen as an individual and functional unit, interacting with its environment. At that time most of researchers didn’t know the mechanism of organs and immunity. The public still thought diseases were caused by disruptions in the balance of the body’s fluids or some other environmental factor. Until the mid-1800s, doctors and scientists have been working to identify pathogens that can cause infectious diseases. Regarding the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Ilya Mechnikov found the existence of phagocytosis while studying the development of starfish larvae, which is the earliest contribution for immunity[1]. He pointed to phagocytosis as one of the immune system's ways of operating. By this he meant that white blood cells work by encapsulating and destroying harmful bacteria and other microorganisms.

  Retrospecting the history of the Nobel Prize, scientists' research in immunology can be divided into three parts: vaccines or infectious diseases, organ transplantation  and cancer.
In 1901, Emil von Behring was awarded for his work on serum therapy for diphtheria[2]. At that time, there was no general knowledge about blood types. Serum therapy is simply injecting the serum of a cured patient into the patient to achieve treatment.It was not perfected until Karl Landsteiner discovered human blood types in 1930[3]. This finding is important, especially in response to hyperacute immune rejection of organ transplantation and acute blood transfusions.Subsequently, Max Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1951 for his discovery of yellow fever and its treatment[4].

## Organ Transplantation History

#### Initial exploration


Regarding organ transplantation history, it dates back to 500 BC, an Indian surgeon used patients' face tissue to finish nose reconstruction, which is the earliest person successful using this technique. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050402.png)
In the 15th century, an Italian surgeon also thought to use patients’ arm muscles to finish nose reconstruction. He also finished skin autografts. 
![image2](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050403.png)
In 1883, Kocher finished the first thyroid transplant. His work, research, and surgery on the thyroid gland also made him awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909[5]. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050404.png)
As mentioned, in 18 century, the body was seen as an individual and functional unit, interacting with its environment. Most researchers didn’t know the mechanism of organs. Under this situation, replacing an organ hadn’t made much sense. In his early year, he was famous for his thyroid excisions. He proposed aseptic surgery and came out with a new method, which is very effective. In the beginning, the surgery was considered a very high-risk operation, the fatality rate is as high as 75%. However, Kocher’s surgery made it decrease to 18%, even 0.5% by 1912. In his hands, the operation became such a safe procedure that he started removing the whole organ. Within this background, most people didn’t know the function of the thyroid.
In his own words,“the physiologists know next to nothing about the physiological significance of the thyroid gland, and this may have been the main reason for surgeons tacitly assuming that the thyroid gland had no function at all.”[5]
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050405.png)
After that, he found there were some patients after the surgeon had some problems. As in the picture above, it was originally a pair of sisters who looked very similar, but after the younger sister completed the operation, she became shorter. There were also some intelligence problems after the operation. 
In April 1883, Kocher sent invitations to 60 of his former patients. He re-examine 34 patients and received written reports from the rest 26 patients. From the latter, he learned that 5 had had cancers and that 2 died from unclear causes after good recoveries, and only 2 showed unchanged or improved general status compared with earlier. From this, it can be seen that most patients' evaluations of surgery are negative, and the results are also negative.

In July 1883, he transplanted thyroid tissue into a patient who had undergone radical thyroidectomy. As an attempt at curing a complex internal disease by replacing an organ, this operation constitutes the first organ transplant in the modern sense.
Thyroid transplants were subsequently also performed for other forms of hypothyroidism. More importantly, they became the prototype for all other organ transplantations and the starting point for decades of research into organ transplantation.

His contribution made him awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909[5]. In my opinion, his first contribution is the physiology, pathology, and surgery of the thyroid gland. His surgery reduced the fatality rate to a very high degree. Second, he self-reflected after the operation. He realized that the complete removal of the organ would lead to other diseases, and then used the method of transplantation to improve his operation. Third, his success story has inspired other researchers and surgeons to consider the possibility of transplant surgery.

In 1892, Anton first did an operation on cats for the parathyroid autotransplant. Since Anton started, surgeons began to use xenotransplants and allotransplants for treating patients. They tried to transplant the pancreas, ovaries, suprarenal glands, and other organs into human beings.

#### Preservation of organs


In 1905, Carrel did the first heart transplantation in a dog. Meanwhile, he is known as vascular anastomosis[6]. His method had reached a new level of technical proficiency. His technique made it possible to link transplanted organs to their respective vascular connections in the host organisms. For these achievements, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1912.
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050407.png)

Carrel is mainly known for his development of vascular sutures. At the beginning of the 20th century, the public thought that connecting arteries and veins was impossible. At that time, there were a lot of wars, and people's lives are threatened. The French president was stabbed with a knife in Italy. Carrel spent long hours refining this technique for vascular anastomosis, called the technique of triangulation. It consisted of placing three equidistant stay sutures and running a fine suture along the flat surface between each stay suture[7]. He also created the ‘Carrel’ patch technique for the replantation of major vascular structures during organ transplantation. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050408.png)
In the transplantation experiment of kidneys of dogs. In order to avoid thrombosis in a small blood vessel anastomosis, a patch of the aorta with the renal artery attached was removed. He was able to show that arteriovenous anastomosis remains patent with a proper technique and that the vein connected to an artery reacts against the increase of blood pressure in the arterial system by thickening its wall. This technique is still in use today.

![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050409.png)


While Carrel is mainly known for his vascular sutures technique, his work and persistence to try to keep tissues and organs alive outside of the body are also important. Carrel defined two different forms of latent life—unmanifested actual life and potential life. The first one is normal progress toward death, the second one is a state in which vital processes are only suspended. Two major concepts of organ transplantation are still based on this simple hypothesis. Cellular death is a slow process, which presents an opportunity to intervene within a certain period for organ rescue or transplantation.


He also proposed that organ preservation is based on the theory of potential life, the organ needs cold storage. then, he tried multiple times but didn’t succeed. Afterward, he thought up an organ perfusion machine to keep the organ alive. It allowed the preservation of organs for as long as 3 weeks Which is a very important breakthrough for organ transplantation.

In 1906, Jaboulay made the first attempts at human kidney transplantation when he transplanted pig and goat kidneys into patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. Unfortunately, the operations were unsuccessful. In fact, all of the above experiments ended unsuccessful, including Carrel's dog experiment. Why did these things happen? Now we know the reason is immunity rejection, but at that time, people didn’t know that specific.

#### Immune mechanism

Until Georg is considered the first transplantation immunologist for his discovery that the body's own system causes transplant rejection. He came out of his book and summarized his research. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050411.png)
Since the publication of his book, most researchers have only considered the issue of immune rejection. Then some other researchers focused on this topic, like Leo Loeb, James, and Simonsen. determined that the strength and timing of rejection of skin homografts in rats were governed by the extent of genetic disparity between donor and recipient. He also showed that the lymphocyte was involved. James and Earl studied determining that identical twins would accept exchanged skin grafts. Simonsen searched in vain for an antibody response. At that time, communication was underdeveloped and with the influence of the two world wars, thirty years after the book was published, there were still many unknowns about the mechanism of immunity.
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050412.png)
In 1943, Peter explored skin homografts for the treatment of burned aviators in WWII. He and his colleague soon reconfirmed that homografts always failed. they realized that this identified rejection as an immunological event. In 1949, another researcher asked a question about how to distinguish identical twins and fraternal twins. Peter answered using a skin trans graft. But this researcher still hoped Peter did one experiment about skin transplantation. Firstly, Peter was not interested in it, because we have mentioned that in 1937, James and Padget had finished the experiment. It can be predicted that Skin grafts can be successful in identical twins, and fail in fraternal twins. But in a real experiment, they found a surprising result. They found that most cows accepted their twin’s graft, they knew that most twins are fraternal and some of the twin pairs they grafted were of different genders.
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050413.png)
Peter wanted to know what happened to these cattles, he found in 1916 Lillie dissected a pair of unborn cattle twins. He found that the chorions of the twins’ placentas were fused, causing a common intrauterine circulation that would allow blood to be exchanged freely between the twins. Lillie also found that when cattle twins were two genders, the gonads of the female were usually rudimentary. He reasoned that male hormones circulating through the female embryo inhibited the development of its reproductive organs.

In 1945, Owen also studied this topic, Owen found that in this species fraternal twins frequently had a mixture of two red blood cell types. Owen concluded that not only hormones but also cellular elements of the blood must be exchanged in utero by twin cattle. He realized that the persistence of red blood cell chimerism in adulthood must depend on intrauterine transfer not only of short-lived red blood cells but also of stem cells that would perpetuate them. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050414.png)
This article inspired Peter, he thought that the stem cells exchanged in utero by these twins would be not only those for red blood cells but also for leukocytes and that these were probably responsible for skin graft acceptance.

In the 1940s, Burnet turned his research topic from Virology to immunity. He published a book. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology. Burnet regarded the "self" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo. Using the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components and by extension the idea of immune tolerance. 
In 1953, Peter and his colleagues found the support evidence for Burnet's hypothesis when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain[7]. Peter and Burnet were awarded the Nobel prize in 1960 for their work on acquired immunological tolerance and this work also provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance.

#### The first kidney transplant

After Peter’s research came out, his colleagues did the induced tolerance experiment and found some mice under the experiment became sick. They found White blood cells of the donor's immune system recognize the new host as foreign, called graft-versus-host disease[8]. This should not be confused with transplant rejection. GvHD is the graft immune system that attacks the host, transplant rejection is the host immune system that attacks the graft. These diseases are often commonly associated with bone marrow transplants and stem cell transplants[9]. At that time, Thomas focused on bone marrow transplantation, he also found this issue. He had a pathological assessment for patients with chronic GvHD, giving them 100 days of MTX to Relieve the disease.ATG was used for acute necessity[10].
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050415.png)
It can be seen that as the patient develops, the inflammation can even spread throughout the body, this disease has a very high fatality rate. If not solve this immune rejection problem, organ transplantation may be ended.
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050416.png)
At that time, Thomas proposed whole-body radiation, and the patient’s bone pain disappeared after x-ray therapy, which is very important for nowadays organ transplantation. And then, Murray and his team performed the first successful kidney transplant in 1954 using as a donor the recipient’s identical twin. Compared with the structure of the heart, the kidney is much simpler. Therefore, it is understandable that the first successful case of organ transplantation in humans was kidney transplantation. 	
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050417.png)
Although kidney transplant experiments have been performed on animals before, it is very exciting to apply them to humans. Subsequently, Murry used total-body radiation finished surgery on 12 patients. Disappointingly, 11 of the 12 irradiated patients died within a month, only one of them alive around 20 years. This was a more important accomplishment than the identical twin case because it was the first time the genetic barrier to human kidney transplantation had been breached.

## Immunity Rejection
#### Allograft

Hyperacute rejection is a form of rejection that manifests itself in the minutes to hours following transplantation. It is caused by the presence of pre-existing antibodies in the recipient that recognizes antigens in the donor organ. 

Once the host recognizes these antibodies, Irreversible damage will be expected. The patient will be very dangerous. The way to avoid it is relatively easy. The incidence of graft failure due to super-rejection has been significantly reduced due to improved antibody screening of donor tissue before transplantation.

Patients may experience acute rejection within 3 months to 1 year of transplantation, which is caused by two distinct immune mechanisms, acute cellular rejection, and acute humoral rejection. Firstly, Lymphocytes recognize antigens on the transplanted organ. This recognition is due to a protein in the cell, the 'major histocompatibility complex (MHC)'. 

Therefore, in addition to ABO blood type screening, HLA matching is also required when organ transplantation. The non-HLA proteins are called minor histocompatibility antigens and generally reduce the risk of acute rejection unless there is a substantial non-HLA protein mismatch. And then, the T-cells’ recognition process can occur directly or indirectly and lead to acute cellular rejection and acute humoral rejection,respectively. 

Acute cellular rejection occurs when T lymphocytes recognize mismatched MHCs and begin to secrete cytokines to recruit more lymphocytes and directly lead to apoptosis. The greater the difference in MHC between the donor and recipient, the faster the T lymphocytes destroyed the graft. Therefore, the HLA matching is very important.

Chronic rejection is an insidious form of rejection that leads to graft destruction over the course of months, but most often years after tissue transplantation. The mechanism for chronic rejection is yet to be fully understood. Chronic rejection is generally thought of as being related to either vascular damage or parenchymal damage with subsequent fibrosis. 

#### Xenograft

To date, no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient's immune system." Xenozoonoses" is one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. This response is more extreme than in allografts, patients may lead to the immediate death of the recipient. Therefore, animals used for transplantation must have precise control over their diet and environment.

Apart from allograft, the hyperacute rejection is caused by XNAs, to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human complement system, which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis, and necrosis of the transplant.

Interruption of the complement cascade will suppress the autoimmune system. Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.

Meanwhile, need to use genetically engineered animals, transgenic organs are used before surgery.
The third one is acute vascular rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if the hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood.

Due to its complexity, the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with multiple approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection,

The rejections above mentioned are humoral immune system. However, cellular rejection is based on cellular immunity and is mediated by natural killer cells that accumulate in and damage the xenograft and T-lymphocytes which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.To overcome cellular rejection, a proposed strategy is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient's stem cells.

## Recent Research
Before illustrating the recent research, I would like to introduce stem cells and two other Nobel laureates. Stem cells originated from two main sources, adult body tissues, and embryos. It is available to differentiate any kind of cell and it proliferates indefinitely in vitro. 

#### Induced pluripotent stem cells

Depending on different sources, researchers can extract and culture embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from embryos. As the level of stem cells declines, their capabilities are getting weaker and weaker. Compared to embryonic stem cells, these multipotency stem cells lose some abilities, which means they can only differentiate partly categories of cells. For example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce blood and immune cells; neural stem cells (NSCs) can differentiate different kinds of neurons, Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be differentiated into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Since iPSCs can be derived directly from adult tissues, they not only bypass the need for embryos but can be made in a patient-matched manner. These unlimited supplies of autologous cells could be used to generate transplants without the risk of immune rejection. Then, just like the pictures shown, patients will be available to use their MSCs or other adult cells to induce iPSCs, 3D cell culture, and bio-printing to make a real organ in the future.
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050418.png)

#### Microfluidic device

About 3D cell culture, a good approach is using the microfluidic device which belongs to a type of microdevice that finish some manipulation such as sample delivery, reaction, detection, and analysis. Due to its small fluid volumes, utilizing the microfluidic device for bioanalysis can reduce device size. 

![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050419.png)
When SCs are in vivo, they are in a 3D dynamic microenvironment. At that time, these cells can interact with surrounding cells or extracellular matrix (ECM) easily. They are exposed to low oxygen content and growth factor gradients which are very important to cell behaviors including differentiation, interaction, self-renewal, etc. The interaction between cells and the environment provides some signals for regulating cell responses. 

Considering this mechanism, it is difficult to simulate these different signals in vitro culture. In traditional approaches, we may use two-dimensional culture. At that time, it is difficult to simulate real biomechanics such as fluid flow and shear stress. Therefore, in vitro experiments often trigger unexpected differentiation, and the death rate is high. When stem cells are in the microfluidic channel, the channel can provide a real 3D microenvironment for stem cells.

#### Extrusion Bio-printing

This is an extrusion 3D bioprinting technique. It has two material microfluidic printheads with integrated pneumatic valves and a coaxial flow focusing extruder capable of generating hydrogel fibers. Integration with a 3-axis positioning system and custom software enables a variety of multi-material structures to be fabricated. Meanwhile, the Flow control over the ratio of hydrogel and crosslinker flow rate enables sequenced 2-material fibers in picture yellow and read with on-the-fly control over fiber diameter.

![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050420.png)

#### Genetically modified pig heart

Just this year in January, there was big news in the organ transplant world. A 57-year-old man in the United States has had a pig's heart transplanted, which is worth memorizing in history. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050421.png)
Although now, he died for unknown reasons this month, it is still a big breakthrough in the organ transplant world. Now we can see what new point is involved in this operation.
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050422.png)
For the genetically engineering, according to the doctor, 10 genetic modifications made to the pig meant its organs would be acceptable to the human body. In genetic engineering, they used the CRISPR technique, which can cut double-strand DNA and insert the DNA they prepared, also can provide a form of acquired immunity. 
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050423.png)
After the organ transplanting, the patient used the ECMO system for several days, to adapt to the new organ. is a life support machine. People used ECMO because they have a severe and life-threatening illness that stops their heart or lungs from working properly. After gradual adaptation, the pig heart replaced the ECMO system, and gradually, the patient could go from lying down to sitting to walking.

## Discussion
With the development of transplantation, some issues have to consider. The first one I think is the safety issue. It arises both the safety of the recipient and the safety of the donor. A transmissible cancer is a cancer cell or cluster of cancer cells that can be transferred between individuals without the involvement of an infectious agent. Patients under transplant treatment have to take immunosuppressive drugs. Their immune system is very weak. They may die from other immune system diseases, or they may develop cancer. There was a case in 2007, 4 people received different organ transplants (liver, lung, and kidney) from a 53-year-old woman who had recently died of intracranial hemorrhage. Before the transplant, the organ donor was medically considered to have no signs of cancer. Later, the organ recipients developed metastatic breast cancer from the organ, and three of them died of cancer between 2009 and 2017. In the near future, xenograft will be another option, how to make sure the animals are safe? If infected with the virus carried by the donor, the person may die immediately. Another question is at hand. When the risk of organ transplantation is further reduced, how can we ensure that we will not become the target of organ smugglers?
![image1](.\assets\img\posts\stock\2022050424.png)
## Summary
In self-study and group study, I learned a lot about the history of organ transplantation and immunization, as well as pathogenesis. However, as the professor said, what we need to learn more is the research methods, thinking methods and spirits of these successful scientists. For me, the stories of the winners have benefited me a lot.

There is no doubt that Kocher is an excellent surgeon. However, if his ideological realm only stays at the level of an ordinary doctor, then, his highest achievement is his surgical success rate. It was because he was always reflecting on himself and considering his surgery with a critical thinking that he discovered the role of the thyroid gland, and thus entered the field of organ transplantation and made great contributions.

Peter was initially not interested in the twin skin transplant experiment, because previous people had done similar experiments and came to the conclusion. However, under the persuasion of another researcher, the cow skin transplant experiment was performed again, thereby discovering the mechanism of acquired immunity. This tells us that we must have a rigorous research attitude towards scientific research. We cannot directly cite the conclusions of others just because they have done similar experiments. Instead, we can repeat their experiments, or look for other studies that come to the opposite conclusion for comparison. It is very important to hear different voices.
