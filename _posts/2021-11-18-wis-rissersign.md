In 1958, Joseph C. Risser, published his findings on growth and the completion of growth in a paper entitled, “The Iliac Apophysis: An Invaluable Sign in the Management of Scoliosis.” His findings led to the Risser sign classification system used to assess skeletal maturity. While Risser sign is still used today by doctors to estimate remaining growth in adolescents, we find that many parents are still unaware of this long-used system.

At Scoliosis 3DC, we are all about empowering families through education. This is so that parents are able to make the very best decisions for scoliosis management. How can a parent/patient hope to manage scoliosis effectively without a complete understanding of the factors that need to be considered during treatment?

For scoliosis awareness month we thought we’d provide some insights on Risser sign (also referred to as stage, classification, grade, value, score, range, etc.) in hopes of adding to your base of knowledge. Subsequent posts will feature cases we’ve treated at various Risser stages.

Risser sign represents the stage of ossification (process by which new bone is formed) of the iliac crest apophysis. Because vertebral growth plates are difficult to visualize/evaluate, Dr. Risser was looking to find an alternative for evaluating vertebral growth potential, since growth potential has tremendous significance when it comes to treating adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Risser found that the “completed excursion and ossification of the iliac apophysis were generally concurrent with that of vertebral growth plates” and that the attachment of the iliac apophysis is an accurate indication of completed spinal growth. 

This finding was key for practitioners treating scoliosis, as they now had another tool to classify scoliosis and make treatment recommendations according to estimated remaining growth potential (along with other factors, such as age, sex, Cobb angle, etc.). Risser sign classifications are on a scale of 0-5. Risser 0 indicates that there is a significant amount of growth remaining, while Risser 5 indicates skeletal maturity.

Doctors follow the amount of ossification on a patient’s x-ray to determine the Risser sign (pelvis must be visualized). This is best seen from an AP (anteroposterior) standing full-spine x-ray and is referred to as ‘capping.’ This capping occurs from the outside to inside of the iliac crest (see image below).

```
Risser 0 – no ossification center at the level of iliac crest apophysis
Risser 1 – approximately 25% apophysis of the iliac crest
Risser 2 – approximately 25-50% apophysis of the iliac crest
Risser 3 – approximately 50-75% apophysis of the iliac crest
Risser 4 – approximately 75% apophysis of the iliac crest
Risser 5 – complete ossification and fusion of the iliac crest apophysis
```

As described above, Risser signs 1-4 can be determined by the amount of capping shown while Risser 0 is when no ossification center is seen in the apophysis and Risser 5 is complete ossification. As shown above, Risser 0 and Risser 5 can sometimes appear similar, so age and long bone growth plates (such as a hand x-ray) can help to distinguish between the two. For reference, the average chronological age of iliac apophysis in girls is 14 years old. In boys, it’s 16. However, it can be earlier or later, depending on the individual. For females, menarcheal status should also be considered (pre-menarcheal females are more likely to be Risser 0 than Risser 5).

Dr. Risser had noted in a previous study that spinal column growth is slower in children between 5 and 10 years old, and faster in children between 10 and 15 years old. That said, once adolescence begins – the risk for scoliosis progression increases.

## Risser Sign 0
Risser 0 is the first Risser stage when ossification of the epiphyseal plate over the iliac crest has not yet begun. In simpler terms, new bone has not yet started forming at the top of the pelvis – indicating significant remaining growth. It can be concerning when scoliosis is diagnosed at Risser 0 as the risk of curve progression is greatest during this time of skeletal immaturity.

When a child with a mild curve presents to an orthopedic surgeon at the Risser 0 stage, surgeons will often tend to recommend a wait and see approach. We disagree with that protocol, and instead view an early diagnosis as an opportunity to use growth as a corrective factor to improve the curvature and postural appearance. Parents need to learn as much as possible about scoliosis in order to make strategic decisions for optimal management.

To be upfront, there is some limited literature stating that very mild curves may resolve. However, with Cobb angles ≥20º this isn’t a likely scenario. It’s why we advocate being proactive and treating sooner rather than later. As Christa Lehnert-Schroth used to say, “no curve is too small to treat.”

## Risser Sign 1
At the Risser 1 stage of growth, a pelvic x-ray will show up to 25% ossification, or “capping” at the top of the iliac crest apophysis from lateral to medial (outside to inside).

Girls typically reach Risser 1 just after menses occurs, however, that’s not a hard and fast rule. We have had several female patients who had not yet experienced menses who presented as Risser 1, 2 and even Risser 3. Weight, hormones, family history and other environmental factors can play a role when it comes to the start of menses, so any of these can be a factor in cases where menses started later than expected. 

## Risser Sign 2

When a child has reached the Risser 2 stage, ossification of the iliac crest apophysis (top of the pelvis) is between 25% and 50% complete. This ossification occurs from lateral to medial (outside to inside, as shown below). Risser 2 means that the child is still growing, but by this point the rate of growth has typically slowed down.

By Risser 2, most girls have experienced menarche, and boys have experienced voice change. Growth continues, although usually not at the rate it has in previous months. That said, the risk of curve progression still exists and there is still a need for curve management.

## Risser Sign 3

When a pelvic x-ray shows about 50-75% ossification of the iliac crest apophysis (from the outside to inside), this indicates Risser 3. As with Risser 2, this growth stage indicates continued but slowing growth, especially for girls. For boys, growth tends to be slow and steady throughout puberty – although this isn’t always the case.

## Risser Sign 4

Risser 4 indicates ossification of the iliac crest apophysis at 75% or more. “Capping” from lateral to medial (outside to inside) is nearly complete and skeletal maturity is approaching. From our perspective, there is more to say about Risser 4 than the other Risser stages. This is due to our use of different management techniques, braces and objectives for patient care compared to traditional medical establishment protocols.

## Risser Sign 5

Risser 5 is the last Risser sign. It indicates skeletal maturity. An x-ray will show complete ossification and fusion of the iliac crest apophysis.
