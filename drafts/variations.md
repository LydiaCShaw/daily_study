Recently, I am very grateful and excited to receive the letter of appointment from Dr. M.S. Wong. That's why the renewing frequency of my blog is slower than before. For my engineering background, I still have a lot of things to learn. Therefore, in this article, I want to summerize and illustrate some new things.

### Assessments
Scoliosis can be observed by body asymmetry such as uneven shoulders, shoulder blade, thoracic hump, loin depression or pelvic tilt. In severe cases, appearance and cardiopulmonary function could also be affected. Observation of the body shape and contour is a simple method to assess the potential of having scoliosis, which may indicate the need for further investigations while it would be difficult for mild scoliosis as those subtle changes may not be noticeable.
