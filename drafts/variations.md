Look at the picture and observe the human faces, extensive research carried out that human faces are asymmetrical and most works of art also follow this rule, such as Venus de Milo. It is obvious that her face is different.

According to Henke, the asymmetrical facial features of the Venus de Milo probably are not the result of a conscious attempt by the artist. He made the portrait in a normal, realistic way depicting usual face structures. The realistic features of the Venus de Milo have made her more natural and human.

There is a clear evidence of asymmetry even when it comes to the size of the upper extremities. Following their studies on 5141 people, Hasse and Dehner found that in 75% of cases, the right arm is longer than the left. Asymmetry was evident not only in the length of the arms, but also in their circumference, owing to better development of muscles on the right side. As for the lower extremities, their findings were as follows:

In 75% of cases, the left limb was shorter than the right; in 18%, both extremities were practically of equal size; and in only 7%, the right limb was shorter than the left. A difference in the length of the left and the right limbs is a characteristic features even in newborns.

In functional terms, asymmetry of the upper limbs is apparent in the marked predominance of right-handedness over left-handedness. On an average, left-handers constitute 5% of adults. Asymmetry of the upper limbs has been observed even in the skeletons of Neanderthals. The presence of asymmetry in the length of the limb bones was observed in anthropomorphic apes.

There are reasons to believe that there is acertain asymmetry of the limbs even in mammals other than human beings, although the asymmetry in such cases is less pronounced. This is illustrated by the fact that animals, like human beings, move in circles when they lose visual control, as in foggy conditions. This is because of the functional predominance of the motor apparatus of one side of the body over that of the other side. In any cases, bilateral asymmetry of the motor apparatus is characteristic not only of humans, but also of all higher vertebrates.

#### Consulation
1. If the patient is  a child, he has usually been brought for consultation because of 
- [ ] scoliotic spinal deformity
- [ ] dizziness
- [ ] impaired vision
- [ ] impaired hearing
- [ ] impaired memory
- [ ] fatigue in the legs
- [ ] cramps in the calf muscles at night
- [ ] emotional lability
- [ ] sweaty hands or feets
- [ ] tendency to constipation and allergies
- [ ] bedwetting
 The number of complaints and their severity depend on the degree of deformation, age, skeletal anomalies, etc.
 2. Among adult patients, the usual complaints include
 - [ ] spinal pain in its various manifestations
 - [ ] in the backdrop of scoliotic posture
 - [ ] degenerative disc disease
 - [ ] spondylosis of varying degrees of severity
 - [ ] muscle pain
 - [ ] tightness in  the cervicothoracic region
 - [ ] fluctuations in the blood pressure
 - [ ] numbness and spasms of the fingers
 - [ ] retrosternal pain
 - [ ] shortness of breath
 - [ ] arrhythmia
 - [ ] extrasystoles
   
 Author's data on spinal deformities and spinal pain can be of great practical value, both for the enquiring patient and the ordinary physician. And, it has been observed that the clinical picture is the same in all individuals, regardless of age and sex. They have treated the youngest patient was two-and-a-half months old and the oldest, 89 years old.
 
 When it comes to the young patient, he was a child wh had just learnt to walk. He already had slight deformation of the chest, which could be felt even through his thin clothing. In the majority of cases the right scapula is protruding. When the child was placed in a prone position and his clothes were taken off, rotational displacement of the spinous processes of the 5th-7th thoracic vertebrae was clearly visible. The processes were located above and below the deformity. Similar curves were observed in the upper thoracic and lumbosacral regions.
 
 When examining infants, palpation of the spine shows that the overall width of the m.erector trunci varies substantially at the site of its attachment to the sacrum. In most casaes, the right part is wider than the left. According to Professor I.A.Movshovich(1964), this is not due to muscle hypertrophy but due to posterior  protrusion of the muscle, caused by deviation of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae as a result of torsion. This explanation is acceptable in the case of a person who is walking, but not in the case of one who is lying down. Also, it does not apply to babies, who cannot walk. How do muscle asymmetry and lateral cervature of the spine appear? What comes first - lateral curvature of spine or asymmetry, if any, between them?
 
 An interesting fact is that muscular asymmetry and spinal deformities are observed not only among infants but also among newborns. Does this mean that everything begins during intrauterine development? 
 
 The fact that this muscular asymmetry was always associated with lateral cervature of the spine is of great importance. Left-sided thoracic curvature was observed in cases in which the width of the left extensors was greater, the trunk curved in the opposite direction. Among children, the curvature of the trunk was manifested minimally, but it  progressed with age.
 
 Asymmetry of the trunk muscles and lateral curvature of the spine were observed among absolutely all patients and even among healthy people who did not have any complaints. In view of this, we believe that it is not unreasonable to suggest that the coexistence of asymmetry of the trunk muscles and lateral curvature of the spine is the law of nature. Also, these two features are often associated with a third one - spinal pain.
 
 It is not only one particular part of the trunk that is characterized by asymmetry. As mentioned earlier, it is typical of the whole body and can be clearly observed in the face as well as the pelvic area. From the frontal view, all individuals, regardless of nationality and without exception, have an asymmetrical face. If the reader wishes to notice the signs of asymmetry in the pelvic region, it is best to observed people during summer, when they are wearing thin clothes. Viewed from the posterior all people have a body asymmetry - one scapula protrudes more posterioely than the other, similarly there is a difference in the sizes of the buttocks.

 ### Origin of body asymmetry
 
 By now, we have seen that asymmetry of the body muscles and lateral curvature of the spine are present among all individuals, and that these are often associated with pain. We already know that spinal pain always appears with scoliotic deformity in the background. Therefore, it was logical to start searching for answers about their origin not in pain as a consequence, but in the initial cause of the lateral curvature of the spine. The development of spinal pain is preceded by the development of asymmetry of the trunk muscles. For this reason, I have raised some questions:
 
 * What causes asymmetry of the body?
 * How does lateral curvature of the spine develop?
 * What comes first - lateral curvature or muscle asymmetry?
 * What is the interrelation between them?
