Scoliosis as a disease is considered one of the most difficult areas of orthopaedics. As the eminent German orthopaedist *A.Schantz* said, spinal diseases are among the most obscure areas of pathology. The problem of scoliosis has been, and remains, a subject of keen interest in all orthopaedic clinics in the world.

The first precise description of scoliosis was given by *Ambroise Par√©* (1510-1590), the famous French surgeon who was also the first to propose treating the condition with a cast made of perforated plates that immobilize the chest. *Hippocrates* knew of scoliosis and placed it the category of serious disorders that significantly shorten the life of a patient. This problem was stuided thoroughly in the early medieval period. He treated scoliosis with respiratory gymnastics, singing and bandaging the chest. He is the one who coined the terms scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. *Glisson, Fabricius and Hildanus* used medical gymnastics and various devices for treatment.

### Anatomical and physiological features of the spine in scoliosis

The human spine consists of 24 vertebrae (excluding the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae), which are more or less firmly interconnected with each other as I mentioned before [in this article](http://linjingshang.top/cssoliosis.html). Seven of them are cervical, 12 thoracic and 5 lumbar. Twelve pairs of ribs(7 pairs of true and 5 pairs of spurious ribs) are connected with 12 vertebrae. The pairs of true ribs are connected with the sternum frontally, the 8th-10th pairs meet anteriorly to form the costal arch, and the 11th-12th pairs end freely without connection to the sternum.

The 24 vertebrae and the discs are surrounded by a framework of dense ligaments and together, these form a strong pillar that supports the body. Despite the fact that the vertebrae are held together very tightly. As a result, the whole spine is characterized by a certain degree of fliexibility. This can be increased significantly through exercise, such as in the case of acrobats, gymnasts and circus performers. Bending forward, backwards and sideways, as well as lateral rotation, are known to increase the flexibility of the spine.

The spine is not straight and has bends, which are considered merely physiological as long as they are within certain limits and are located in the frontal plane. The following curvatures of the spine are recognized: anterior curvature of the cervical spine(lordosis), posterior curvature of the thoracic spine(kyphosis),lumbar lordosis and finally, kyphosis of the sacrociccygeal region.
