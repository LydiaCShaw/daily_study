Recently, I am very grateful and excited to receive the letter of appointment from Dr. M.S. Wong. That's why the renewing frequency of my blog is slower than before. For my engineering background, I still have a lot of things to learn. Therefore, in this article, I want to summerize and illustrate some new things.


### Assessments
Scoliosis can be observed by body asymmetry such as uneven shoulders, shoulder blade, thoracic hump, loin depression or pelvic tilt. In severe cases, appearance and cardiopulmonary function could also be affected. Observation of the body shape and contour is a simple method to assess the potential of having scoliosis, which may indicate the need for further investigations while it would be difficult for mild scoliosis as those subtle changes may not be noticeable.

In our group, we mainly detect whether children have uneven shoulder and shortening leg. But firstly, 
* step 1, we would give them basic body measurements such as height,weight, arm span and calculate the BMI.

* Afterwards, step 2, A.C.T. Pelvic Level would be used to detect wheter they have pelvic tilting.

The A.C.T. Pelvic Level can be the clinicianâ€™s most valuable tool for quick and accurate assessment of leg length discrepancies. You can find that there is a small bubble in the middle in picture above. 

Leg length imbalance is determined by pressing the expandable wings of the tool onto the crest of the pelvic bones. It is very sensitive, if both sides are uneven, the bubble will move to the higher side. So when you get a detection, if you found the bubble is on the right hand side, which means the leg of the right direction for you (the left direction for patient) is longer and right lower limb is shorter. At that time, we may record the shorten one, so I should be careful, and record the same one with the direction of bubble.

* step 3, there are some different types of wood boards, 2mm, 3mm, 5mm, 10mm. If patient has uneven pelvic, we may ask him to step on the plank, elevating the short limb until the bubble on the level is centered. 

Leg length discrepancies are very common in the population but often not diagnosed. The A.C.T. Pelvic Level quickly and accurately determines if the pelvis is horizontally in plane. By shimming up the short limb, a measurement for determining the amount of correction can be determined. 

As a screening tool, the A.C.T. Pelvic Level can help the practioner to quickly screen patients for a condition which may indicate an anatomic or functional leg length discrepancy.

Before this, some authors have used the measurement tool of the diagram below.

Compare it with A.C.T, I have to admit that A.C.T is better so it insteads the former steadily.

* step 4, once the bubble on the level is centered, we may record the thickness of the plank. Afterwards, patients need to step on the plank and finish the trunk listing.

As the image shown, we have a laser source. We align the laser source at the midline of the patient's hip, and then record the distance of the laser source at the same level as the C7.

After recording the result of trunk listing, Adam's forward bend test is arranged then. We normally use scoliometer and spinescan two kinds of tools. 

* step 5, scoliometer is shown below, that has a range from 0 to 30 degree on both sides. There is also a small ball in the middle. However, be careful,
