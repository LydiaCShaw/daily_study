In optimal conditions, an organism and its organs develop without any abnormalities. However, the normal path of embryonic development could be disrupted and the evolving organism could become abnormal, with certain organs or even the whole body becoming anomalous. The causes of such deviations may be external or internal.

Abnormalities of organs can be manifested as follows:
1. The organ may be positioned wrongly.
2. The organ may be absent (aplasia).
3. The organ may merge with adjacent organs.
4. There may be an additional organ.
5. The shape of the organ may be altered.

About the anomalies of the spine, *V.A. Dyachenko's* classification(1954) is the most complete one.

#### Ontogenetic anomalies
1. Developmental anomalies of the vertebral bodies:
   a. Clefts and defects of the vertebral body
   b. Wedge-shaped vertebrae body
   c. Other malformation of the vertebral body, platyspondylia and microspondylia
2. Malformations of the vertebral arches:
   a. Clefts
   b. Partial hypoplasia of the vertebral arch
   c. Abnormal development of the vertebral processes
   d. Anomalies in the interarticular space of the arch (spondylolysis)
3. Mixed anomalies:
   a. Anomalies of segmentation
   b. Hypoplasia of entire regions of the spine
   c. Hypoplasia of certain vertebrae

#### Phylogenetic anomalies
1. Anomalies of the craniocervical region:
   a. Assimilation of the atlas
   b. Manifestation of the atlas
2. Anomalies of the cervicothoracic region:
   a. Dorsalization of the lower cervical vertebrae(cervical ribs)
   b. Cervicalization of the 1st thoracic vertebra
3. Anomalies of the lumbosacral region:
   a. Sacralization
   b. Lumbarization
4. Anomalies of the sacrococcygeal region

#### 1. Clefts and defects of vertebral bodies
Congenital clefts or the condition in which the vertebrae remain unfused and open are known as 'spina bifida'. In the majority of cases, these defects are caused by disorders in the development of the vertebral
