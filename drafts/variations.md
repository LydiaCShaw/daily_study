###### Normal EEG rhythms

EEG waveforms can be classified into 5 different frequency ranges: 
* ①Delta rhythm (0.5-4Hz) 
* ②Theta rhythm (4-7.5Hz) 
* ③Alpha rhythm (8-13Hz) 
* ④Beta rhythm (14-26Hz) 
* ⑤Gamma rhythm (above 30Hz).

The patterns and physiological of normal EEG rhythms are very important for clinical diagnosis and neurological research. For most of healthy human, alpha waves exist when they are awake, quiet and closed their eyes. The alpha waves appear in the occipital lobe. 

When one opened eyes, the alpha wave was gradually replaced by the beta wave.

For these infants 3 to 5 months after birth, the delta wave begins to decrease. Subsequently, the theta wave appears mainly in the parietal and occipital areas. As children growing, theta wave will reduce, instead, the alpha is gradually dominant and finally similar to adults.

By detecting EEG rhythms, doctors can judge whether patients have some diseases or sleep problems. The clinical symptom may be faster frequency and larger amplitude that is considered to be abnormal rhythm.

There are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use: 
* ①auditory evoked potentials, usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level; 
* ②visual evoked potentials;
* ③somatosensory evoked potentials, which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. 
  
 Besides, event-related potential (ERP) is a special brain evoked potential that used in EEG. The main components of ERP are P1,N1,P2,N2, and P3. P1, N1 and P2 are exogenous potentials;
 
 N2 and P3 are endogenous potentials. These potentials are not only the manifestation of the pure physical activity of brain, but also reflect some mental or psychological activity.
 
 
In EEG signals, there are some large signals above 75μV,which is called artifact. The artifact occurred at the beginning of the motion of open eyes when one try to detect,I may consider the mainly reason is Rapid eye movements (REMs), which results from saccades and spontaneous changes of gaze. When subject blinks, this phenomenon may occur because the eye is a dipole, relatively positive at the corneal surface and negative at the retinal surface, leading to a moving charge and potential change. Another artifact may because of the motion of swallowing. The tongue is similar to the eye and makes muscle artifact.


In general, the amplitude of alpha wave tends to highly symmetrical. It is usually considered normal symptom that the amplitude on right side is higher than that on left side except the asymmetry is greater than 50%. Meanwhile, the frequency is symmetrical as well, if one side is slower than the other side, abnormal function will occur on the slower side. In clinic, this symptom is notable to observe. Therefore, we mainly use EEG to diagnose diseases. For example, infantile spasms are mostly high-amplitude slow waves, sharp and no rhythm. Purulent encephalitis is mostly delta waves, which mainly appear in the back of the cerebral hemisphere. Tuberculous meningitis has extensive theta waves.
