Look at the picture and observe the human faces, extensive research carried out that human faces are asymmetrical and most works of art also follow this rule, such as Venus de Milo. It is obvious that her face is different.

According to Henke, the asymmetrical facial features of the Venus de Milo probably are not the result of a conscious attempt by the artist. He made the portrait in a normal, realistic way depicting usual face structures. The realistic features of the Venus de Milo have made her more natural and human.

There is a clear evidence of asymmetry even when it comes to the size of the upper extremities. Following their studies on 5141 people, Hasse and Dehner found that in 75% of cases, the right arm is longer than the left. Asymmetry was evident not only in the length of the arms, but also in their circumference, owing to better development of muscles on the right side. As for the lower extremities, their findings were as follows:

In 75% of cases, the left limb was shorter than the right; in 18%, both extremities were practically of equal size; and in only 7%, the right limb was shorter than the left. A difference in the length of the left and the right limbs is a characteristic features even in newborns.

In functional terms, asymmetry of the upper limbs is apparent in the marked predominance of right-handedness over left-handedness. On an average, left-handers constitute 5% of adults. Asymmetry of the upper limbs has been observed even in the skeletons of Neanderthals. The presence of asymmetry in the length of the limb bones was observed in anthropomorphic apes.

There are reasons to believe that there is acertain asymmetry of the limbs even in mammals other than human beings, although the asymmetry in such cases is less pronounced. This is illustrated by the fact that animals, like human beings, move in circles when they lose visual control, as in foggy conditions. This is because of the functional predominance of the motor apparatus of one side of the body over that of the other side. In any cases, bilateral asymmetry of the motor apparatus is characteristic not only of humans, but also of all higher vertebrates.
